Called the ‚ÄúBillionaire Minimum Income Tax,‚Äù it would assess a 20% minimum tax rate on U.S. households worth more than $100 million. Over half the revenue could come from those worth more than $1 billion. ‚ÄúThis minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters,‚Äù the document said. The proposed levy is expected to reduce the deficit by about $360 billion in the next decade, according to the document. If a wealthy household is already paying 20% on their full income, they won‚Äôt pay an additional tax under the proposal. If they pay less than 20%, they‚Äôll owe a ‚Äútop-up payment‚Äù to meet the new minimum. ‚ÄúAs a result, this new minimum tax will eliminate the ability for the unrealized income of ultra-high-net-worth households to go untaxed for decades or generations,‚Äù the document stated. The new tax proposal is part of Biden‚Äôs 2023 budget expected to be released on Monday. His new spending plan would trim $1.3 trillion from the deficit over the next decade, according to a fact sheet released from the White House on Saturday. What remains to be seen is whether Congress will move forward on Biden‚Äôs proposal. Last year, Senate Democrats unveiled a billionaires‚Äô tax, which would have levied the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest Americans. The measure ultimately did not proceed. In fiscal year 2021, the federal deficit totaled nearly $2.8 trillion ‚Äî about $360 billion less than in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The swift economic recovery after pandemic lows is also a factor in lowering the deficit. The White House credited the American Rescue Plan, crafted to support relief to struggling Americans during the Covid crisis, for helping the economy grow 5.7% in 2021. Not only will less economic and pandemic support be needed for people and businesses, but a stronger economy means higher incomes for households and businesses. Because of this, the government is projected to collect more than $300 billion in additional revenues compared to last year, the fact sheet stated."
/r/politics/comments/tewol7/us_senate_approves_bill_that_would_make_daylight/,1647370132,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-approves-bill-that-would-make-daylight-savings-time-permanent-2023-2022-03-15/,92654,U.S. Senate approves bill to make daylight saving time permanent,"The U.S. Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent starting in 2023, ending the twice-annual changing of clocks in a move promoted by supporters advocating brighter afternoons and more economic activity. The Senate approved the measure, called the Sunshine Protection Act, unanimously by voice vote. The House of Representatives, which has held a committee hearing on the matter, must still pass the bill before it can go to President Joe Biden to sign. The White House has not said whether Biden supports it. A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to say if she supports the measure but said she was reviewing it closely. Senator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, said supporters agreed the change would not take place until November 2023 after input from airlines and broadcasters. The change would help enable children to play outdoors later and reduce seasonal depression, according to supporters. ""I know this is not the most important issue confronting America, but it's one of those issues where there's a lot of agreement,"" Rubio said. ""If we can get this passed, we don't have to do this stupidity anymore."" ""Pardon the pun, but this is an idea whose time has come,"" he added. The National Association of Convenience Stores opposes the change, telling Congress this month ""we should not have kids going to school in the dark."" On Sunday, most of the United States resumed daylight saving time, moving ahead one hour. The United States will resume standard time in November. Since 2015, about 30 states have introduced legislation to end the twice-yearly changing of clocks, with some states proposing to do it only if neighboring states do the same. The House Energy and Commerce committee held a hearing on the issue last week, where Representative Frank Pallone, the committee's chairman, said, ""The loss of that one hour of sleep seems to impact us for days afterwards. It also can cause havoc on the sleeping patterns of our kids and our pets.‚Äù Pallone backs ending the clock-switching but has not decided whether to support daylight or standard time as the permanent choice. At the hearing, Beth Malow, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division, argued daylight savings time makes it harder to be alert in the morning, saying it ""is like living in the wrong time zone for almost eight months out of the year."" Pallone cited a 2019 poll that found 71% of Americans prefer to no longer switch their clocks twice a year. Supporters say the change could prevent a slight uptick in car crashes that typically occurs around the time changes and point to studies showing a small increase in the rate of heart attacks and strokes soon after the time change. They argue the measure could help businesses such as golf courses that could draw more use with more evening daylight. ""It has real repercussions on our economy and our daily lives,"" said Senator Ed Markey, another leading sponsor. Daylight saving time has been in place in nearly all of the United States since the 1960s after being first tried in 1918. Year-round daylight savings time was used during World War Two and adopted again in 1973 in a bid to reduce energy use because of an oil embargo and repealed a year later. The bill would allow Arizona and Hawaii, which do not observe daylight saving time, to remain on standard time as well as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

/r/politics/comments/ttd3ql/house_passes_bill_to_limit_cost_of_insulin_to_35/,1648770566,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/health/insulin-price-house-bill-democrats.html,77883,House Passes Bill to Limit Cost of Insulin to $35 a Month,"WASHINGTON ‚Äî A bill to limit the cost of insulin to $35 a month for most Americans who depend on it passed the House on Thursday, raising Democrats‚Äô hopes that the party could take at least one step toward fulfilling its promise of lowering drug costs. The bill attracted unanimous support from Democrats who voted, as well as from 12 Republicans, making it a rare piece of bipartisan policy legislation. To become law, the bill will need to attract at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Some lawmakers involved in the effort have expressed optimism that such a coalition might be possible, but few Republican senators have publicly endorsed the bill yet. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has been working with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a broader bill related to insulin prices. The bill would have substantial benefits for many of the nearly 30 million Americans who live with diabetes. Insulin, a lifesaving drug that is typically taken daily, has grown increasingly expensive in recent years, and many diabetes patients ration their medicines or discontinue them because of the cost. About one in five Americans who take insulin would save money under the proposal, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. But the insulin bill represents a substantial scaling back of Democratic ambitions to tackle high drug prices for all Americans. A broader prescription drug package, written as part of the $2.2 trillion social spending and climate bill that has stalled in the Senate, would limit price increases on all prescription drugs, improve the generosity of Medicare‚Äôs drug coverage, and allow the government to negotiate directly on the price of some drugs used by Medicare patients, while also limiting insulin co-payments. Other parts of the broader bill would expand health insurance coverage, extending insulin coverage to diabetes patients who are uninsured. The bill that passed the House on Thursday would not improve the affordability of insulin for people who lack health insurance. The insulin bill may be the Democrats‚Äô best chance of passing part of their popular prescription drug agenda, as the future of the larger package remains unclear. ‚ÄúIf the effort to address drug prices ends with this plan to cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin, it will amount to crumbs compared to Democrats‚Äô initial ambitions to allow the government to negotiate drug prices,‚Äù said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. On the House floor, several Republicans expressed their opposition to the measure. ‚ÄúWe all share the goal of reducing the cost of insulin,‚Äù said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ‚ÄúThis bill, however, is not the right answer.‚Äù The pharmaceutical industry opposed the drug price regulations in the social spending and climate legislation, but it has not vocally opposed the insulin bill. While the bill would lower costs for many individual patients who take insulin, it would do nothing to reduce the prices paid to the companies that make it. Instead, insurance companies would simply pay a larger share of the price. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would increase government spending, since health insurers, including Medicare, would be responsible for a greater share of insulin costs. But consumer insulin costs have emerged as a politically potent problem, given how widespread diabetes is in the United States, and one that is relatively easier to solve than the prices for prescription drugs overall. At a White House event in December, President Biden centered a speech about prescription drugs around the cost of insulin. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs safe to say that all of us, all of us, whatever our background, our age, where we live, we can agree that prescription drugs are outrageously expensive in this country,‚Äù Mr. Biden said at the event, where patients with diabetes told their stories of struggles to afford the medicine. Debate on the broader legislation has slowed, but has not died. Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a key centrist holdout, has expressed support for the prescription drug provisions in the bill, even as he has been more skeptical about other parts of the package. At her weekly news conference on Thursday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California tried to cast the passage of the insulin bill as progress toward the party‚Äôs broader drug-pricing agenda. She described insulin prices as a ‚Äúkitchen-table issue.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is for us a step in the direction of the secretary being able to negotiate for lower drug prices beyond insulin,‚Äù she added, referring to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Senate‚Äôs Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is a co-sponsor of similar insulin legislation in her chamber. She said she remained committed to passing a full suite of prescription drug price reforms, but that she viewed the insulin issue as particularly urgent. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on insulin, because it affects so many Americans in so many specific ways,‚Äù she said."

The lack of an official White House notation of any calls placed to or by Trump for 457 minutes ‚Äî from 11:17 a.m. to 6:54 p.m. ‚Äî on Jan. 6, 2021 means there is no record of the calls made by Trump as his supporters descended on the U.S. Capitol, battled overwhelmed police and forcibly entered the building, prompting lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence to flee for safety. The 11 pages of records ‚Äî which consist of the president's official daily diary and the White House switchboard call log ‚Äî were turned over by the National Archives earlier this year to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.

Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, called the reported gap in the log ""concerning."" ""Obviously, there is not a second in the day that the president of the United States is not on record somewhere,"" Thompson told CBS News on Tuesday after a White House bill signing event. He said the committee would see ""if we can piece it together."" ""Having a record of what the president was doing on that day is absolutely vital to the work of the committee,"" Thompson added. Thompson also said that the committee does not yet have any evidence that there were calls the president had made or received in that time period, but ""if the Capitol of the United States is being overrun, somebody made some calls. And we just have to find them."" The House panel is now investigating whether Trump communicated that day through backchannels, phones of aides or personal disposable phones, known as ""burner phones,"" according to two people with knowledge of the probe, who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information. The committee is also scrutinizing whether it received the full log from that day. The records show that former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon ‚Äî who said on his Jan. 5 podcast that ""all hell is going to break loose tomorrow"" ‚Äî spoke with Trump twice on Jan. 6. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment. In a statement Monday night, Trump said, ""I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard the term."" But former Trump national security adviser John Bolton said in an interview Tuesday, after the CBS News-Washington Post reporting had been published, that he recalls Trump using the term ""burner phones"" in several discussions and that Trump was aware of its meaning. Bolton said he and Trump have spoken about how people have used ""burner phones"" to avoid having their calls scrutinized. A Trump spokesperson said that Trump had nothing to do with the records and had assumed any and all of his phone calls were recorded and preserved."

Gabbard had asserted, accurately, that the U.S. funds bio labs in Ukraine, not bio weapons labs. In a tweet posted on Sunday, the 2020 presidential hopeful cited the risk posed by biological laboratories at a time Moscow has been pushing a consipiracy theory that they are working on bio weapons in an apparent attempt to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a video, Gabbard said the ""undeniable facts"" are that 25 to 30 ""U.S.-funded bio labs"" in Ukraine are conducting research into dangerous pathogens. Gabbard went on to express concerns that these ""deadly pathogens"" could be released if the labs in Ukraine are targeted amid the conflict with Russia. ""Like COVID, these pathogens know no borders,"" Gabbard said. ""If they are inadvertently or purposely breached or compromised, they will quickly spread all throughout Europe, the United States and the rest of the world, causing untold suffering and death."" Gabbard has also recently appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to discuss claims of Ukraine developing bio weapons, clips of which were played on Russian state television. Gabbard did not repeat the claims of Ukraine developing bio weapons with U.S. military backing, yet a number of people criticized Gabbard's tweet for appearing to echo falsehoods being peddled by Russia. GOP rep. Adam Kinzinger tweeted that Gabbard was spreading ""actual Russian propaganda"" and accused her of being ""traitorous."" Others also accused Gabbard of appearing to be working on behalf of Russia by helping them spread conspiracy theories about U.S.-funded bio labs in Ukraine. David Weissman, a U.S. Army veteran known for no longer supporting Donald Trump, tweeted: ""Can it be any more clearer? Comrade Tulsi Gabbard's latest video proves Hillary Clinton's claim to Tulsi being a Russian asset."" Jon Cooper, a prominent Barack Obama fundraiser and former National Finance Chair of Draft Biden 2016, added: ""Who's the bigger TRAITOR‚ÄîTucker Carlson or Tulsi Gabbard?"" Screenwriter and Forbes contributor Mark Hughes wrote: ""Tulsi Gabbard is a traitor & a Russian agent who belongs in military prison."" In a reply to Gabbard's tweet, director Gerard Bush called the congresswoman a ""treasonous liar; a Russian asset and a stain on American democracy."" Bush added: ""Have you [no] moral compass? How low are you willing to go in support of Putin, while betraying your own country? Despicable."" Republican Senator Mitt Romney gave some of the harshest condemnation of the former Hawaii Democratic Congresswoman, tweeting that she is ""parroting false Russian propaganda"" and that her ""treasonous lies may well cost lives."" While the World Health Organization recently advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens being housed in their labs to prevent an outbreak if they are attacked, there is no evidence that the U.S. is funding work on bio weapons. The White House, Pentagon and State Department have all dismissed the reports that the U.S. and Ukraine are working together to create biological and chemical weapons, describing the conspiracy theories as ""laughable"" and an attempt from Moscow to justify its ""own horrific actions"" in Ukraine. The U.S and Ukraine have been working together since 2005 to research deadly pathogens as part of the Pentagon's Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP). The partnership between the U.S. Defense Department and the Ukraine Ministry of Health is part of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program (CTR), which began in 1991 with the aim of reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction following the fall of the Soviet Union. According to a fact sheet released by the Defense Department, the U.S. works with Ukraine and other countries to research the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans. Through BTRP, the U.S. has invested $200 million in Ukraine since 2005 to support 46 Ukrainian laboratories and their research into disease threats. Such work in Ukraine helped the country in its response to the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no evidence of U.S.-funded labs in Ukraine developing germ warfare capabilities. Similar conspiracy theories have been pushed by Russia for decades, including claims that HIV/AIDS was developed in a U.S. military lab. In January, weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine, the Defense Department release a video to discuss the ""false allegations"" regarding its CTR program, including stating that each country's biological laboratories are ""owned, operated and managed by host governments to meet local needs."" Gabbard has been contacted for comment."

After 3 Weeks of Doing Absolutely Nothing,"Three weeks after the so-called ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Convoy‚Äù landed in Washington, D.C., the group is calling it quits after accomplishing nothing except injuring residents and circling the Beltway. Co-organizer Mike Landis announced Sunday night that the group would pack its things up in the coming days and drive back to California. ‚ÄúSo what I want to know is, what do you think about heading to California?‚Äù Landis asked, to the crowd‚Äôs delight. ‚ÄúSounds like a great plan,‚Äù one convoy-goer yelled back. Landis further said that convoy-goers who remain posted up in Hagerstown, Maryland‚Äîwho have experienced many freezing nights while camped out in the small town an hour and a half north of D.C. proper‚Äîwill enjoy a southerly route back to California. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna take a little more southern route, so it‚Äôs a little warmer than this,‚Äù he said. He pledged to ‚Äúcome back to finish this job‚Äù in the metro area at some unspecified time, which seems highly unlikely as their crowd dwindles. The announcement comes after lead organizer Brian Brase fled Hagerstown again over the weekend amid continued splintering within the group. ‚ÄúI am not running away,‚Äù Brase said in an attempt to convince the crowd Saturday night. Convoy organizers didn‚Äôt return The Daily Beast‚Äôs request for comment on Sunday night. Over the past three weeks, the convoy has struggled to gain traction with lawmakers in Washington. The group met only with Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, and a handful of House Republicans while never brokering a meeting with a single Democratic lawmaker despite attempts to do so. From claiming that average D.C. residents who flipped off truckers during their never-ending Beltway loops were agents of ‚Äúantifa,‚Äù to being hilariously trolled by a single bicyclist and eventually getting a permit swatted down by the U.S. Park Service, the convoy kept stepping on rakes. ‚ÄúSix antifa vehicles! Six antifa vehicles,‚Äù one trucker yelled over the CB radio on March 16 while the convoy circled the Beltway and annoyed commuters as its presence triggered Metro PD to close exit ramps. ‚ÄúKeep your heads on a swivel!‚Äù another trucker chimed in. During its final week in Hagerstown, the group became increasingly desperate, with two of its medics leaving and factions emerging between those who believed the convoy was ‚Äúcorrupt[ed]‚Äù and those who thought it wasn‚Äôt. Morale was also dropping fast, and it appeared that the $2 million raised was drying up quickly, as organizers increasingly tightened the restrictions on how and when fuel reimbursements would be distributed to truckers. Brase, the group‚Äôs de facto leader, had previously told The Daily Beast the convoy could go on ‚Äúindefinitely.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a process that we are hoping to do diplomatically,‚Äù Brase said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in it for the long haul.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe could go indefinitely, right now, if that‚Äôs what it takes,‚Äù he concluded. ‚ÄúWe are not going away.‚Äù"

Until yesterday. In January 2014, Larry Thompson's sister-in-law called 911 after noticing his baby had a rash. That call resulted in several police officers showing up at Thompson's Brooklyn apartment, entering without a warrant, arresting him when he objected to that, jailing him for two days, and charging him with obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest after they allegedly lied about what happened. The initial 911 call was bogus: Thompson's sister-in-law struggles with mental illness and assumed the mark was a sign of sexual abuse; an inspection at the hospital revealed it to be diaper rash. The charges resulting from that call were bogus as well; the prosecutor ultimately moved to dismiss them, and a trial judge closed the case. Yet when Thompson attempted to sue the officers involved, he was barred by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit: In order to bring such a suit, victims were required to prove that false charges were dropped because the defendants in question had affirmatively proven their innocence. Which is no feasible task. ""When charges are dismissed, you generally have no opportunity to introduce evidence, let alone indicate your innocence,"" says Amir Ali, Executive Director of the MacArthur Justice Center and an attorney for Thompson. Yesterday, the highest court in the country struck that requirement down, ruling that Thompson should indeed have a right to sue the officers at the center of his case. ""A plaintiff such as Thompson must demonstrate, among other things, that he obtained a favorable termination of the underlying criminal prosecution,"" wrote Justice Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court. ""We hold that a Fourth Amendment claim‚Ä¶for malicious prosecution does not require the plaintiff to show that the criminal prosecution ended with some affirmative indication of innocence."" The absurdity of that standard was not lost on the court. ""Requiring the plaintiff to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence would paradoxically foreclose a‚Ä¶claim when the government's case was weaker and dismissed without explanation before trial, but allow a claim when the government's evidence was substantial enough to proceed to trial,"" wrote Kavanaugh. ""That would make little sense."" It was an untenable status quo, says Marie Miller, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that filed an amicus brief in Thompson's case. It ""just flipp[ed] the whole principle of innocent until proven guilty on its head,"" she tells Reason. ""In criminal proceedings, they're designed with the presumption of innocence in place. Criminal proceedings aren't designed to allow a person to prove that they're innocent. Indications of innocence are very rare."" Whether Thompson will actually get to bring his suit before a jury is still far from guaranteed. He will have to convince the 2nd Circuit that cops lacked probable cause to arrest him, and he will have to overcome qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that shields state and local government actors from federal civil liability if there is no court precedent outlining the alleged misbehavior with a sort of crystalline exactitude. (An example: Two cops in Fresno, California, were shielded from a lawsuit after allegedly stealing $225,000 during the execution of a search warrant, because the plaintiffs could find no court ruling on the books that said stealing under such circumstances violates the Constitution.) But Thompson and Ali have at least cleared one hurdle. ""You have false charges potentially upending someone's life, whether it's being thrown in jail, losing a job, being forced to attend criminal hearings on false charges over the course of months,"" says Ali. ""And then when they finally succeed in getting those charges dismissed, they're told that they have no recourse in federal court against the police officer who caused it all to happen."" Alleged victims of malicious prosecution will still face many barriers to getting before a jury. But, as of this week, such claims are no longer dead on arrival."

Calls like Warren's have been amplified in recent months. Student-loan payments have been paused, with interest waived, for two years as part of pandemic relief. Biden extended that pause for his third time through May 1. That date is quickly approaching, and some lawmakers and advocates say that if Biden doesn't extend it for a fourth time, he should cancel student debt broadly before 43 million federal borrowers get thrown back into repayment. There are signs that more relief may be coming. Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, suggested to ""Pod Save America"" two weeks ago that borrowers could expect some sort of student-debt relief before the expected payment-resumption date. ""The president is going to look at what we should do on student debt before the pause expires, or he'll extend the pause,"" Klain said, adding: ""The question whether or not there's some executive action on student-debt forgiveness when payments resume is a decision we're going to take before payments resume."" elief before the expected payment-resumption date.

More recently, Politico reported the Education Department directed student-loan companies to halt sending notices to borrowers regarding the payment-restart date, which suggested the department was preparing for a different, likely later, date to resume collecting student debt. Still, Biden pledged during his campaign to approve $10,000 in student-debt cancellation for every borrower, and his silence on the issue has some voters frustrated. A student-loan borrower previously told Insider it was ""upsetting"" Biden had not yet fulfilled his promise. ""I would be shocked, and I'd be thrilled to go to the voting booth if they do do it,"" he said, referring to student-loan relief. ""But right now, they need to earn my vote, and right now, they're not doing it."" Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the idea of more student-loan relief. A group of House Republicans recently called student-loan forgiveness ""reckless"" and ""short-sighted,"" citing the cost the relief would have to taxpayers and the economy. Warren has previously sounded the alarm on the effect failure to cancel student debt would have on elections, and she's not the only Democrat to do so. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said in December it would be ""actually delusional"" to think Democrats could win an election without delivering on progressive priorities, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts told Insider that ""the ultimate persuasion is impact, and Democrats win when we deliver bold, impactful policies that improve the daily lives of our constituents."""

The lawsuit alleges that the U.S. Election Integrity Plan — led by Shawn Smith, an ally of former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and MyPillow founder Mike Lindell — is sending armed members door-to-door in areas with large numbers of voters of color, questioning people about how they voted and taking photographs of their homes. The lawsuit, which is backed by the state chapter of the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and Mi Familia Vota, alleges that the ""voter intimidation"" campaign violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, a post-Civil War law aimed at preventing white vigilantes from terrorizing Black people to stop them from voting. The lawsuit cites the ""County & Local Organizing Playbook"" used by the group, which instructs members to ""undertake citizen audit activities to either refute or confirm serious allegations of election malfeasance"" in order to ""support future legal action."" The group, some of whose members are armed, has been going door-to-door in El Paso, Mesa and Weld counties in Colorado, using public voter lists to identify areas where they believe ballots were fraudulently cast, the Colorado Times Recorder reported last year. The report prompted an alert from Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who warned voters of unofficial canvassing efforts and urged residents to report harassment and threats to local law enforcement or the Justice Department. RELATED: Mike Lindell's new genius plan: Knock on your door and ask whether you're dead ""Defendants' objectives are clear. By planning to, threatening to, and actually deploying armed agents to knock on doors throughout the state of Colorado, USEIP is engaged in voter intimidation,"" the lawsuit states. ""USEIP's public-facing actions are a clear signal to Colorado voters — especially voters of color — that to vote in an upcoming election means facing interrogation by potentially armed and threatening USEIP agents at their doorstep thereafter."" The lawsuit claims that some members have worn ""badges"" and falsely accused voters of fraud. ""Sometimes armed and donning badges to present an appearance of government officiality, USEIP agents interrogate voters about their addresses, whether they participated in the 2020 election, and — if so — how they cast their vote,"" the complaint says. ""It is reported that multiple agents have claimed to be from 'the county,' and have, without any evidence, falsely accused the residents of casting fraudulent ballots."" The voting rights groups say the group's efforts to seek out areas where they believe voter fraud occurred has largely focused on high-density housing areas and communities experiencing a growth in the number of minority voters. ""No one should have to be afraid to go to the polls or fear that doing so will mean being threatened in their own homes,"" Courtney Hostetler, senior counsel for Free Speech for People and one of the lawyers leading the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""Free and fair elections can only occur when people know that they are able to safely vote without reprisal or intimidation."" The group's ""playbook"" thanks Lindell, a leading election conspiracy theorist. Smith, the group's founder, attended Lindell's election conspiracy-laden ""symposium"" last year in South Dakota along with former Colorado election clerk Tina Peters, who was indicted earlier this month for her role in leaking sensitive voting system data that was published by QAnon conspiracy theorists and right-wing websites. Griswold's office said earlier this year that Smith had also convinced another election official, Elbert County Clerk and Recorder Dallas Schroeder, to make copies of his office's hard drives that he later gave to ""unauthorized people in violation of Election Rules."" Shawn Smith, the head of USEIP last month led a ""lock her up"" chant while discussing Griswold at a rally and said that ""if you're involved in election fraud, you deserve to hang."" He can also be seen in a video among a group of violent Trump supporters who clashed with police outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He was accompanied by Colorado state Rep. Ron Hanks, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate who has also pushed false election claims. Smith is also the president of another ""election integrity"" group called Cause of America, also funded by Lindell, which Smith announced on Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast. USEIP appears to have fully embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory. Its website and the first page of its ""playbook"" include the slogan ""We Are the Plan,"" frequently associated with QAnon believers. During a presentation organized by Sherronna Bishop, the former campaign manager for Rep. Lauren Boebert, USEIP leader Cory Anderson (who is also a member of the anti-government Three Percenter militia) described the briefing as ""being red-pilled,"" according to the Times Recorder. (That expression, originally drawn from ""The Matrix,"" is popular among QAnon followers and other far-right conspiracy theorists.) RELATED: FBI raids home of Lauren Boebert's ex-campaign manager in Colorado election tampering probe The lawsuit names Smith, as well as co-founders Holly Kasun and Ashe Epp, who was also at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. It alleges that their attempted canvassing for election fraud evidence had the ""purpose and effect of intimidating Coloradans from voting, trying to vote, helping others to vote, supporting or advocating for certain political beliefs, or exercising the right to speak, peaceably assemble, or petition the government for redress of grievances, in violation of Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act."" The suit also accuses the group of violating a section of the Ku Klux Klan Act that bans ""conspiracy to interfere with civil rights."" ""Sadly, efforts to intimidate voters are nothing new,"" NAACP general counsel Janette McCarthy Wallace said in a statement. ""The NAACP has a long and proud history of opposing those who would seek to thwart democracy. We could not sit idly by and allow voters to potentially be bullied out of exercising their rights."" The lawsuit does not offer specific examples of voters being intimidated or harassed by armed canvassers, but last year USEIP leader Charity McPike urged armed members to provide ""security"" for the group. ""We are attempting to line up security. However, anyone who carries protection might want to let us know so we can offer your cell phone numbers to those who are concerned,"" McPike said, according to Colorado Pols. ""No voter should ever feel threatened in the safety of their own homes,"" Celina Stewart, League of Women Voters chief counsel, said in a statement. ""The nefarious actions of the USEIP are a blatant form of voter intimidation used to target and with the intent to silence Colorado voters of color, which is in clear violation of the Voting Rights Act."" The USEIP is also working with the Colorado Republican Party on its ""Election Integrity Operations,"" according to the Times Recorder. A USEIP member is in charge of the GOP's program and has given joint presentations with Epp, the group's co-founder. Heidi Ganahl, the leading Republican candidate for Colorado governor, promoted the group during a recent event, declaring that they are ""doing great things."" USEIP did not respond to a request for comment. The group's website says it plans to expand to other states, including Arizona, Georgia and New Hampshire. Its training materials are already being used by conspiracy theorists in Utah who call themselves the Utah Voter Verification Project, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Residents in Hurricane, Utah, alerted Washington County officials in December that members of the group, who refused to identify themselves, showed up at their doors with personal voter information, according to the report. The members also recorded voters without their consent. ""We can record anyone without telling them. We don't need permission,"" one unidentified trainer told the outlet. The group's training manual also stressed that ""you do not have to identify yourself at all."" The goal of the Utah group appears to be to collect affidavits from voters who claim to have evidence of illegal votes. In the wake of Trump's 2020 defeat, his legal team attempted to submit voter affidavits to prove their debunked allegations, but those efforts were almost entirely rejected by judges and discredited by election officials. There has been no credible evidence of voter fraud in Utah, which Trump won by more than 20 points. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox and Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson condemned those who are spreading ""misinformation"" about the election and dismissed claims of fraud as ""absolute falsehoods."" Other Trump supporters have tried similar door-to-door audits. Cyber Ninjas, the bankrupt company that led Arizona's failed ""forensic audit,"" sought to send canvassers door-to-door in Maricopa County but ultimately relented after the Justice Department warned that such an effort would violate federal laws against voter intimidation. Another group called the New Mexico Audit Force also sent its members door-to-door in heavily Republican Otero County, which had already spent $50,000 on an ""audit"" confirming that Trump had won the county by more than 25 points. The House Oversight Committee last Thursday announced a probe of the effort, warning that the audit ""illegally interferes with Americans' right to vote by spreading disinformation about elections and intimidating voters."" USEIP also appears to have had trouble vetting its volunteers. The group's training manual says that the group intends to check volunteers' social media and called on them for a ""gut check,"" saying leaders had ""learned (roundaboutly) that there were a couple of people in our group, who were volunteering for our events, who had a criminal history of sexual misconduct,"" and adding, ""it's unfortunate that we must check volunteers for pedophilic leanings."""

""It is often said that Nixon's cover-up was worse than his underlying crime. The reverse is potentially true for Trump,"" Jill Wine-Banks wrote in an op-ed article published by NBC News. ""Trump's records gap is 25 times as long as Nixon's, but his alleged crime could be incalculably worse,"" she concluded. Trump is under scrutiny over a gap of seven hours and 37 minutes in the White House's call logs on the day of the Capitol riot. The absence of these call records has also prompted the House January 6 committee to investigate what one unnamed lawmaker has called a ""possible cover-up."" ""A lot can be said in 457 minutes,"" Wine-Banks wrote. ""Comparisons to the 18.5-minute gap in a crucial President Richard Nixon recording were immediately obvious to me."" Wine-Banks, who cross-examined Nixon's secretary in 1973 about the gap, also observed she was ""not the only to make that connection"" between Trump and Nixon. ""First, Nixon's gap seems — based on my experience and other experts — to have been a deliberate erasure,"" she wrote. ""Is Trump's? We don't have enough evidence to say for sure yet, but the missing chunk certainly appears deliberate."" Wine-Banks said the missing information in Trump's case seemed ""suspicious"" and prompted a ""series of urgent follow-up questions."" ""It is unlikely, even incredible, that no one called in to the president for 457 minutes during a crisis when he was in the White House,"" she wrote. ""Even calls that go unanswered in the White House should be listed on official logs."" Wine-Banks added that while the gap in Nixon's conversation was ""about covering up a third-rate burglary,"" any calls that Trump made during the insurrection were notable given scrutiny about whether he broke any laws while trying to cling to power after losing to Joe Biden in the 2020 US election. The Watergate scandal centered on the Nixon administration's efforts to cover up its involvement in a 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington, DC. The scandal led to Nixon's resignation from the presidency in August 1974. Parallels were often drawn between Watergate and the numerous scandals that plagued the White House during Trump's presidency."
/r/politics/comments/tvkg07/rep_matt_gaetz_votes_against_capping_insulin/,1649021196,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/04/rep-matt-gaetz-votes-against-capping-insulin-prices-says-people-should-just-lose-weight/,67211,"Rep. Matt Gaetz Votes Against Capping Insulin Prices, Says People Should Just Lose Weight","On Thursday, the House passed a Democratic-sponsored bill to cap the price of insulin at $35 a month for most Americans, an effort to crack down on price-gouging by drug makers who have raised the price of a lifesaving product used by millions of Americans by almost 500 percent in recent years. Some people now pay more than $1,000 a month for insulin to treat diabetes, even with insurance. Democrats had been seeking a way to rein in drugs prices overall in a broader policy proposal, but it had little chance of passing the Senate. Hoping for bipartisan compromise, they siloed the insulin price control as its own measure. Still, only 12 House Republicans voted in favor of a bill that’s wildly popular with the American public. Among those voting “no” was Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), the GOP’s leading troll, who has come up with perhaps one of the most offensive justifications for GOP opposition to the popular bill. In his newsletter Friday, Gaetz told his constituents that he opposed the bill because fat people, not Big Pharma, are responsible for driving up the cost of insulin. He suggested that Type 2 diabetes, which is often linked to obesity, could be cured if only people would workout more and lose weight, at which point they wouldn’t need insulin anymore and the drug costs would fall without government intervention. Gaetz wrote: While Democrat posturing of H.R. 6833 victimizes insulin payees as people with an uncontrollable disease that are being taken advantage of and need Big Brother to throw them a raft, lifestyle changes en masse would expeditiously lower demand and the subsequent prices of insulin. 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes, which “can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.” Arbitrary price controls are no substitute for individual weight control. Since 2000, the number of diabetes cases in the U.S. has nearly doubled. The demand for insulin has increased and the requisite price increase has followed suit. In other words, the price of insulin increases as waistlines increase. More than a quarter of Florida residents are obese, including Gaetz’s favorite Palm Beach resident, former president Donald Trump. And more than 10 percent of the state’s population suffers from diabetes, not all of which is caused by lifestyle factors. Gaetz’s attempt to sympathize with them was probably not very convincing. “While I empathize with all Americans suffering from disease and will continue to fight Big Pharma, I voted against H.R. 6833,” he wrote. “I will not see a reemergence of FDR price controls and join the Democrats in their attempt to pave the Road to Serfdom.” This isn’t the first time Gaetz has shown real scorn for overweight people. In January, on his podcast “Firebrand,” he decried Twitter’s banning of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for “telling the truth” about the relationship between Covid and obesity. After a segment about his advocacy for medical marijuana, he warned that legal weed was “not an excuse for America to sit home fat and high.” He decried “woke” culture for “cheerleading for the chubbies.” “I’m not here to fat shame anyone,” he said. “I’d have no room to talk. I know personally how challenging issues of weight can be. I’m frequently way behind in my own goals. But society has now gotten to the point where it’s considered verboten to consider that a daily salad might make you more resilient to all kinds of disease than the vax of the month pushed by Big Pharma. Where’s Michelle Obama when you need her?” He expressed nostalgia for the former First Lady’s “Let’s Move!” campaign and puzzled over how the country had gone from her push for a better diet to the current “obesity-embracing woketopia,” where people are accusing “the Body Mass Index of being a tool of white supremacy.” Even his own colleagues are not immune from Gaetz’s obesity scorn. He once took a potshot at Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who has openly discussed his struggle with obesity and went through weight-loss surgery in August 2002, suggesting that Nadler should be put in charge of the “congressional weight loss program.” While Gaetz may claim to empathize with people struggling with weight issues, he clearly doesn’t think he’s one of them. In August, he declared that he didn’t “fit in” with other members of Congress because most of them are old, obese people."

In an interview on Real America's Voice show Just the News, Trump pushed unsubstantiated claims regarding President Joe Biden's son, and his dealings in Russia. The former president repeated an accusation that Hunter Biden's company received $3.5 million from Elena Baturina, the widow of former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, a claim he often made during the 2020 election campaign. ""Why did the mayor of Moscow's wife give the Bidens—both of them—three and half million dollars? That's a lot of money,"" Trump said. ""She gave him three and half million dollars. So now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer."" Thomas Gift, founding director of University College London's Centre on U.S. Politics, told Newsweek that by appealing for Putin to ""smear"" Hunter Biden, Trump is doing ""what Trump does best"" by ""trolling the media, cozying up to authoritarians,"" and timing his comments for ""maximum shock value."" This is also not the first time that Trump has asked Russia for help getting political dirt against one of his opponents. In 2016, Trump called on Russia to try to find 30,000 emails associated with his then election rival Hillary Clinton, which were deleted during her time as Secretary as State. Trump was impeached for the first time over allegations he threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky promised to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings ahead of the 2020 election. Trump denied pressuring the Ukrainian leader in several media reports published around the time. Trump has now been condemned for asking Putin to help unearth information on Hunter Biden amid the war in Ukraine, where Russia is accused of committing war crimes by purposely targeting civilians and hospitals. Author, journalist and attorney Seth Abramson wrote: ""President Biden is America's commander-in-chief; we're at the brink of open war with Russia; Putin is unambiguously an enemy of America. ""So one would expect any info Putin releases about our commander-in-chief to be a lie—and yet Trump now begs for Putin's aid. Open treachery."" Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat, tweeted: ""Vladimir Putin is a war criminal and a butcher. Here are two responses—President Biden: This man cannot remain in power. ""Trump: Please help me Vladimir. I am damn proud of our current President. And nauseated by the former President."" Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison added: ""Trump, the leader of the GOP, loves Putin more than he loves America. It has been evident for a while that the man seriously needs some professional help."" Richard Painter, attorney and former chief White House ethics lawyer under the George W. Bush administration, described Trump as a ""sleazeball"" and a ""traitor"" over his comments. Filmmaker Andy Ostroy said: ""This traitor is seeking personal gain right now from a brutal enemy of America who's literally slaughtering innocent men, women, pregnant women, children and babies and decimating cities. Lock...his...a**...up."" Trump's latest remarks also arrived after he praised Putin as a ""genius"" and ""savvy"" for his tactics gearing up to the all out invasion of Ukraine in late February. Trump later doubled down on his remarks, telling a crowd at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that the Russian president Putin was ""pretty smart"" as he had ""taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions."" Speaking to Newsweek, Gift added: ""As the rest of the world looks on at Russia's aggression in horror, Trump, in typical Trumpian fashion, sees a golden opportunity to keep his name in the headlines—and it's working. ""His recent comments calling Putin a 'genius' and 'savvy' garnered plenty of media attention, so it's hard not to think this is just him going back for seconds. ""Consider: As Joe Biden expresses his moral indignation over Putin—admitting he personally wants Russia's leader ousted from power and labeling him a 'war criminal'—Trump is content to solicit support from the same adversary. The contrasts couldn't be sharper."" Trump has been contacted for comment."
/r/politics/comments/tphuio/wife_of_supreme_court_justice_texted_trumps_chief/,1648379783,https://truthout.org/articles/wife-of-supreme-court-justice-texted-trumps-chief-of-staff-to-overturn-election/,63523,Wife of Supreme Court Justice Texted Trump‚Äôs Chief of Staff to Overturn Election,"Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, exchanged text messages with former President Donald Trump’s chief of staff during his final months in office, urging him to take action to overturn the legitimate outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Conservative activist Ginni Thomas sent at least 29 text messages to Mark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff, between Election Day 2020 and January 2021, encouraging him to disregard the election results and to continue pushing false claims of fraud in order to keep Trump in office. The text messages were included in documents that Meadows handed over to the select committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021. The attack occurred directly after Trump gave an incendiary speech to a mob of his loyalists, telling them that they would “never take back [the] country with weakness,” and instructing them to go to the Capitol while both houses of Congress were in the process of certifying the election. Although Ginni Thomas recently admitted that she had attended the “Stop the Steal” rally before the attack, she claims that she played no part in organizing the event. However, her texts make it clear where she stood on the matter. In a text she sent just days after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the election by several news outlets, Thomas encouraged Meadows to help Trump “stand firm” against the legitimate outcome. “You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice,” she wrote. “The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” Two weeks later, Meadows wrote to Thomas that “this is a fight of good versus evil,” telling her that he was doing what he could to keep Trump in office. “The fight continues. I have staked my career on it,” Meadows said. “Well at least my time in DC on it.” Thomas replied to Meadows: “Thank you!! Needed that!” In another text, Thomas fretted over allowing Biden to be certified as the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election. “We just cave to people wanting Biden to be anointed? Many of us can’t continue the GOP charade,” she said. The texts also reveal that Thomas encouraged the Trump White House to “release the Kraken” — a reference to comments at the time from Trump-aligned lawyer Sidney Powell, who promised to release proof of fraud that would demonstrate the need to overturn the election. (Such proof never came about, and allegations of widespread election fraud have repeatedly been debunked) “Sounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud,” Thomas texted Meadows in November. “Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.” The texts between Thomas and Meadows don’t reference the work of Justice Clarence Thomas, but the exchanges do indicate a conflict of interest, especially considering the justice’s actions on the bench since then. In a recent interview, Ginni Thomas defended her political work as being separate from her husband’s. “We have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too,” she said. “Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me, and I don’t involve him in my work.” Clarence Thomas has never recused himself from any case that his wife was involved in. Supreme Court justices are encouraged to recuse themselves from cases where a conflict of interest may arise — specifically, “in any proceeding in which his [or her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” However, there is no law or regulation that requires them to do so, and the decision is left up to the individual justice themselves. Notably, Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter in a Supreme Court case earlier this year, voting against all eight other justices in a matter regarding documents from the Trump administration that the January 6 committee sought to investigate. Trump argued that those documents were protected by “executive privilege,” but the Supreme Court ultimately allowed a lower court’s ruling to stay in place, meaning that the documents could be shared with the committee. Clarence Thomas’s dissent now appears to indicate a clear conflict of interest, commentators noted. “What did Clarence Thomas know and when did he know it? Was Ginni Thomas abetting a coup? We need to find out,” said Washington Post opinion columnist Jennifer Rubin. The government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also weighed in on the matter, outlining a timeline of the events. “Ginni Thomas texted Mark Meadows trying to get help in overthrowing the election,” the group wrote. “Trump tried to get the Supreme Court to stop Congress from getting docs about Jan 6. Meadows filed an amicus brief in support of Trump. Clarence Thomas was the only justice to vote to block the docs.” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-California) criticized Clarence Thomas for not recusing himself from a case that involved his wife. “Ginni Thomas can do whatever crazy things she wants. But Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas cannot rule on a case that would disclose the crazy things Ginni Thomas was doing,” Lieu said. “That was a clear conflict of interest. Justice Thomas once again dishonors the Supreme Court.” Sarah Lipton-Lubet, executive director for Take Back the Court Action Fund, an organization that seeks to “inform the public about the danger that the Supreme Court poses to democracy,” called on Clarence Thomas to resign from his position as a result of the revelations regarding his wife’s texts seeking to overturn the election — and for Congress to take action if he doesn’t. “Given that Justice Thomas has already made known he won’t recuse himself from cases related to his wife’s right-wing activism, and the damning evidence of his wife’s involvement in this attack on our democracy, Thomas is clearly unfit to serve on the nation’s highest Court,” Lipton-Lubet said. “Clarence Thomas must immediately resign from his seat on the Supreme Court. If he refuses, Congress must move to impeach him.”"

While votes for the 2020 election were being counted, Trump Jr. texted then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows laying out a strategy to keep President Donald Trump in power by throwing out election results of key swing states, CNN reported Friday. The disclosed texts shed further light on recent revelations of Trump and his inner circle's efforts to block the certification of the 2020 election. ""It's very simple,"" Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, according to CNN. ""We have multiple paths We control them all."" The texts between Trump's eldest son and the top White House aide describe a course of action to keep the president in power: prevent swing states from certifying their results through lawsuits and demanding recounts. After casting doubt on the election's legitimacy, GOP-controlled Legislatures could assemble pro-Trump slates for the Electoral College, according to CNN. As a last resort, Trump Jr. described how if neither the president nor Democrat Joe Biden had enough electoral votes, the House would vote by state delegation to pick the winner, according to CNN. ""Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,"" Trump Jr. texted. ""Once again Trump wins."" Legal experts and others reacted to the texts by calling for Trump Jr. to be prosecuted for trying to subvert the 2020 election. ""This was an attempted putsch,"" Richard Painter, a law professor and former chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, said on Twitter. ""He belongs in the slammer!"" Glenn Kirschner, a former U.S. Army prosecutor who serves as an NBC News/MSNBC legal analyst, said on Twitter that the messages were clear proof that Trump Jr. was part of his ""father's criminal conspiracy to overturn the election."" ""How long do we have to endure this open, treasonous criminality by Trump and company before someone gets indicted?"" wrote Kirschner. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu wrote on Twitter that ""This sure looks like an illegal conspiracy."" The text messages from Trump Jr. align with other efforts to prevent Congress from certifying Biden as the winner of the 2020 election. A federal judge ruled last month ruled that Trump ""more likely than not"" committed a felony by trying to obstruct Congress. The ruling was in response to a civil court case brought by the January 6 committee to compel Trump adviser John Eastman to hand over documents.

Texas law also explicitly exempts a woman from a criminal homicide charge for aborting her pregnancy. In a statement made to the Associated Press last week, the Starr County Sheriff’s Office merely stated that Herrera was charged after “intentionally and knowingly causing the death of an individual by self-induced abortion.” On Sunday, the district attorney’s office stated that this was “not a criminal matter.” “In reviewing applicable Texas law, it is clear that Ms. Herrera cannot and should not be prosecuted for the allegation against her,” District Attorney Gocha Allen Ramirez wrote. The case was brought to the attention of the sheriff’s office by a hospital, according to Ramirez’s statement. Calixtro Villarreal, Herrera’s attorney, declined to comment when reached by phone Sunday. Texas enacted a law in September that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, using a novel legal strategy that empowers private citizens to enforce the law through civil litigation. But that law does not appear to have applied in this case. Herrera faced a criminal charge, not a lawsuit. Additionally, that law does not allow lawsuits to be filed against the person who had an abortion, only those who helped facilitate it. “If [prosecutors] are literally charging her with murder under Texas law, it’s likely they either forgot about the exception for murder or they have some other theory for why this could apply,” Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law who specializes in the federal courts and has closely followed the Texas abortion ban, said Saturday. Abortion rights organizations quickly mobilized to support Herrera. The Frontera Fund, a group that raises money for Texas patients to access abortions, organized a rally Saturday morning outside the Starr County jail and raised awareness of the case on social media. “This arrest is inhumane,” Rockie Gonzalez, founder of the Frontera Fund, said in a statement Saturday. ""We stand in solidarity with you Lizelle, if you are reading this, and we will not stand down until you are free.” Herrera’s arrest comes as Republican-led states across the country are passing a flurry of antiabortion legislation ahead of a Supreme Court decision this summer that could overturn or significantly weaken Roe v. Wade, the case that has protected the constitutional right to abortion for nearly 50 years. Her case could be an early sign of what is to come if Roe is overturned, Vladeck said. When prosecutors charged Herrera, they might have been thinking of a pre-Roe abortion ban that is still on the books in Texas, Vladeck added, but has not been in effect since 1973 because it is unconstitutional under Roe. Nine states still have pre-Roe bans, which could come back to life depending on what the Supreme Court decides in June. “We could see more of this,” Vladeck said."

He was there to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, as well as to watch President Biden sign an executive order aimed at improving the law. Obama’s return created plenty of commotion, and for Fox News and the rest of the right-wing ecosphere, a fresh opportunity to cast Biden as a weaker, watered-down version of the former president. The Republican National Committee shared two clips of the visit that quickly went viral. The first shows an ostensibly confused Biden ambling around the stage as Obama holds court behind him. The second is similar, with Biden standing on the periphery as Obama greets well wishers. The clips even made it onto the Fox News primetime slate. “Biden doesn’t know what on earth he’s doing or, at times, where he even is,” Lauran Ingraham said as she played the first clip. Tucker Carlson played the second, along with a “King Obama” graphic depicting the former president wearing a crown and a menacing scowl. “Make it stop,” Carlson said. “It’s awful.” The only problem is that both clips were taken out of context. Biden does look a little confused in the first clip, but it’s only because he’s looking for someone, perhaps Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, whom he brings up onstage to applause shortly after the conservative media cut ends. The second clip ends right before Biden gets Obama’s attention and introduces him to someone. Twitter user @acyn helpfully attached the full clips to the end of the Fox News segments lambasting the edited versions. Newsmax got in on the action, too. The network on Tuesday ran a “PRESIDENT OBAMA 2.0” graphic along with a bizarre chyron about how Biden and Obama are “beta males.” It also showed the clips, both with similar deceptive edits. “At one point he’s just walking aimlessly through the room,” an on-air commentator said on Wednesday morning. “It’s really sad. He doesn’t know where to go.” “This is a lost old man. This is when I pulled out the 25th Amendment,” another added before arguing that the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of the president from office if they’re unable to discharge their duties, could be in play before 2024. “I believe it is if the evidence continues to mount that President Biden is actually incapable of performing his job,” she said. Biden’s effectiveness as a president is up for debate, but conservative media feeling the need to doctor video clips of the president proves there isn’t as much evidence that he can’t do the job as they’d like there to be."

The Texas Republican was accused by social media users of a “performative tantrum” at the hearing after he ignored repeated requests from senator Dick Durbin, the chair of Senate Judiciary Committee, to stop speaking after his allotted time. Mr Cruz had quizzed the federal judge about her views on issues of race and crime and why she handed down lighter sentences in cases he displayed on a chart. He was in the middle of asking more questions when Mr Durbin interjected, saying the senator’s 20-minute time had expired. “You can bang it as long as you want,” Mr Cruz shot back at the chairman. “I just want you to play by the rules,” Mr Durbin told the Republican senator as the heated tirade continued. “I know you like to interrupt, but you have consumed a substantial time of my questioning, and I’m going to ask my questions. And if you want to testify, you are welcome to,” Mr Cruz said before proceeding to ask Ms Brown Jackson about her record on cases related to child pornography. Shortly after the argument, Mr Cruz was photographed checking his phone. LA Times reporter Nolan D McCaskill shared Mr Cruz’s photo and said it “looks like he’s checking his mentions after his back and forths with KBJ [Ketanji Brown Jackson] and [Dick] Durbin”. Kent Nishimura, a photo journalist from the newspaper and McCaskill’s colleague, shared a photo of Mr Cruz from a different angle and “confirmed” the senator was ""searching Twitter for his name... right after his exchange with Chairman Durbin”. Several commentators attacked Mr Cruz on social media after the hearing. “Just throw Ted Cruz out. I’m serious,” wrote author Majid M Padellan. “Ted Cruz: We’re running out of time. Everyone watching the hearing: Praise the lord,” said legal analyst Joyce Alene. Meanwhile at the confirmation hearing, Republican senators signed a letter demanding files of Ms Brown Jackson’s cases and insisted the panel probe deeper into the judge’s decision making. The chairman dismissed the request as unprecedented, calling it a “fishing expedition” he would not allow."

The legal action filed in Georgia by a group of voters asked state officials to prevent the proudly outspoken congresswoman from seeking a second term in elections to be held in January. At the heart of the legal action is a claim that the 47-year-old Donald Trump loyalist has rendered herself unfit for office through her support for protesters who attack the US Capitol building on Jan 6 2021. A provision of the US constitution that was passed in the 19th Century and known as the “Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause” prohibits politicians from running for Congress if they have engaged in “insurrection or rebellion” against the United States. It also says they cannot seek office if they have “given aid or comfort” to the nation’s enemies. The action in Georgia voters is being spearheaded in part by Free Speech For People, a Texas-based advocacy group that brought a similar challenge to North Carolina Republican Congressman Madison Cawthorn’s qualifications for office. A federal judge dismissed the case against Mr Cawthorn on March 4, but Free Speech for People has urged North Carolina officials to appeal that ruling. “Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment, known as the Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause, provides: “No Person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress. . . who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress . . . to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof”, the group said in a statement. “The purpose of the Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause, passed in the wake of the Civil War, is not to punish the oathbreaker but rather to protect the country.” It said there was widespread evidence that Ms Greene, a first-term congresswoman elected in 2020 to Georgia’s 14th congressional district, had supported attempts to undermine Joe Biden’s victor over Mr Trump and claimed, falsely that the election was rigged. The legal filing, which is 40 pages long, alleges “Greene voluntarily aided and engaged in an insurrection to obstruct the peaceful transfer of presidential power”. There was no response to the lawsuit from Ms Greene, and her office did not immediately respond to questions from The Independent. Ms Greene has downplayed and justified the Jan 6 2021 attack when hundreds of supporters of Mr Trump stormed the federal legislature building in Washington as part of a campaign to “stop the steal”, an effort to undermine Mr Biden’s victory and prevent him from taking office. The day of protests, which started with with a fiery speech from Mr Trump, were part of post-election effort by the then-president to overturn the results, something that failed in at least 60 rulings in different courts “Jan 6 was just a riot at the Capitol and if you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants,” Ms Greene said during a radio programme in October. She has also visited those detained after the protests and called them “political prisoners”. The legal challenge will be heard by an administrative law judge. Ms Greene could also ask a federal judge to step in and block the challenge."

Trump’s remarks, in an interview with discredited far-right journalist John Solomon, were published Tuesday by the “Just the News” television show on the Real America’s Voice network. In making his claims about Hunter Biden, Trump cited the findings of a controversial, highly politicized investigation by Senate Republicans into the Bidens, which was published just weeks before the 2020 election and produced little new evidence of wrongdoing. Trump has repeatedly promoted dubious claims of foreign business dealings by Hunter Biden, specifically alleging that he received millions of dollars from the wife of Moscow’s late mayor, Yury Luzhkov. “She gave him $3.5 million so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it,” Trump said in the interview, conducted at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “I think we should know that answer.” Trump failed to mention that he himself sought to do business with Luzhkov’s government in the late 1990s, according to POLITICO. Trump also was pursuing high-profile real estate deals in Russia as recently as 2016, including a proposed Trump Tower Moscow. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on Trump’s remarks. Attorneys for Hunter Biden did not immediately return a request for comment. Hunter Biden revealed in 2020 that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware was investigating his tax affairs. POLITICO also reported at the time that the securities fraud unit in the Southern District of New York scrutinized his finances. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the federal tax investigation into Hunter Biden is gaining momentum, with prosecutors in Delaware seeking information and grand jury testimony in recent weeks. Trump’s new interview is far from the first time the former president has suggested or openly demanded that foreign governments intervene to damage his domestic political rivals. In 2016, Trump publicly asked the Russian government to obtain and release emails from the private email server that then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton used during her tenure as secretary of State. In 2019, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for allegedly withholding crucial military aid from Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced investigations targeting the Bidens and other Democrats on discredited allegations. Trump’s new request of Putin raises the specter of those scandals, as the Russian president plods on with his more than monthlong war in Ukraine and Zelenskyy’s forces continue to fend off the invaders. Trump described Putin’s invasion of Ukraine as “genius” and “savvy” last month, and he argued that Joe Biden was “almost giving [Putin] an incentive” to deploy nuclear weapons amid the conflict last week."
/r/politics/comments/todg92/bernie_sanders_wants_a_95_tax_on_big_corporations/,1648260486,https://www.businessinsider.com/sanders-windfall-tax-large-companies-cut-high-prices-2022-3,51167,Bernie Sanders wants a 95% tax on big corporations' pandemic-era profits to bring down rising prices,"Bernie Sanders once again wants to tax big corporations. This time, he's proposing a 95% tax on the record profits firms are raking in amidst 40-year-high inflation, ballooning costs, and a pandemic. On Friday, Sanders introduced the ""Ending Corporate Greed Act,"" cosponsored by fellow progressive Senator Ed Markey, with New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman introducing the legislation in the House. Under Sanders' plan, companies that make over $500 million in annual revenue would be taxed 95% on their ""windfall profits."" That amount would be calculated based on their average profit level in the five years leading up to the pandemic. Deemed a ""temporary emergency measure,"" the tax would only be in place from 2022 to 2024. In a release, Sanders said the levy would bring in $400 billion in just one year. ""We cannot allow big oil companies and other large, profitable corporations to continue to use the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the specter of inflation to make obscene profits by price gouging Americans at the gas pump, the grocery store, or any other sector of our economy,"" Sanders said in a release. The Sanders bill would pursue excess profits more aggressively than other Democratic proposals in Congress. That's due to its planned tax on every large US corporation, not just those in the oil and gas sector. Another windfall tax proposal from Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island would target only oil and gas companies, and use the funds to provide direct payments. Here's how much some firms would have paid in 2021, based on calculations from Sanders's office: Berkshire Hathaway: $66.1 billion Amazon: $28.6 billion JP Morgan Chase: $18.8 billion Chevron: $12.9 billion It's not an unheard of measure: As Sanders notes, similar taxes were enacted during World War Two and the Korean War. Windfall profit taxes have also historically targeted oil prices and profits. In fact, President Richard Nixon proposed such a tax on oil prices. ""It just isn't fair, for example, for millions of Americans to make sacrifices in order to deal with the crisis we confront and for a few to make excess profits or what we would call windfall profits,"" Nixon said in 1973. It's not likely to get through Congress. Republicans tend to be averse to any tax increases and some centrist Democrats may also squirm at levying a tax on excess profits on every US company. ""During these troubling times, the working class cannot bear the brunt of this economic crisis, while corporate CEOs, wealthy shareholders, and the billionaire class make out like bandits,"" Sanders said."
/r/politics/comments/thun1z/joe_biden_didnt_do_this_republicans_say_the_white/,1647694580,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/dont-blame-biden-for-gas-prices.html,50795,Joe Biden Didn‚Äôt Do This,"As gas prices have surged over the past several months—and shot up even further following Russia’s incursion into Ukraine—Republicans have predictably tried to pin blame on the White House. “Joe Biden caused this and doesn’t seem to care,” the Republican National Committee’s deputy communications director tweeted last week, echoing the stickers that Trump-voting motorists have been slapping onto gas pumps across the country. But President Joe Biden did not cause this. In fact, other than sanctions against Russia—which the GOP broadly supported—the primary reasons why filling up your tank has gotten more expensive over the past year have almost nothing to do with America’s chief executive. This shouldn’t be a surprise, since presidents almost never have much direct control over gas prices. But unfortunately voters act like they do, which is sort of the sad cosmic joke of American politics. But I digress. Let’s debunk the argument, shall we? Why Absolutely Nothing Republicans Are Saying About Gas Prices Makes Sense Members of the GOP have been saying that a big reason the cost of gas soared over the past few months is that the president simply hasn’t let oil companies drill enough. Specifically, they say, the White House has bottled up American fossil fuel production by issuing fewer oil leases on federal lands and by stopping pipeline construction. For example: Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee complained in a letter this month “there has not been one lease sale on federal lands since you imposed a ban in violation of federal law.” (They implored Biden to “take the shackles off American energy.”) And the House Republicans’ campaign chief blamed the gas price spike on the administration shutting down “drilling on federal lands,” “freezing all the permits” offered to oil drillers, and “killing the Keystone XL pipeline.” It is true that U.S. oil production is lower now than it was in in February of 2020, when it hit an all-time record high of 12.8 million barrels. (That was before the market crashed at the onset of the coronavirus crisis.) But based on the GOP’s rhetoric, you might be tempted to think that U.S. oil production had collapsed since Biden stepped into the Oval Office. That’s just not the case: In fact, oil production has actually increased, from about 11 million barrels per day to 11.5 million barrels through 2021. As Biden himself noted last week when announcing sanctions on Russian energy, domestic oil companies pumped more crude during the first year of his presidency than in the first year of Donald Trump’s. The number of oil rigs operating in the United States is still growing, too. Indeed, much to the frustration of climate activists, Biden has actually done very little to slow fossil fuel production on federal property. Biden did promise to halt new drilling on federal lands during his campaign. And in the first months of his term, he temporarily paused the sale of new public oil leases. But a federal judge struck down this pause in June, and then, in November, the Biden administration held the single largest-ever auction of oil and gas drilling leases from the Gulf of Mexico, locking in a future guarantee of more than 1 billion new barrels of oil from that region. (It’s worth noting that the administration was not required to make this sale, as the Justice Department itself admitted—it was entirely the government’s choice.) The Biden administration also did pause sales again last month, after a Trump-appointed judge blocked the administration from considering climate costs when auctioning oil leases. So it’s a GOP-approved official who’s forced this halt on land sales while the administration rejiggers its energy accounting. More to the point: Even if Biden had approved the Gulf of Mexico tracts earlier in his term, or leased more federal lands before the current pause, it wouldn’t have made much difference in today’s oil prices. It would have taken many months—in some cases, years—to extract, refine, and put those billion barrels on the market. It’s also false to say the Keystone XL pipeline’s shutdown plays a role here. Last June, when Biden canceled an important permit for the Alberta-to-Nebraska crude pipeline, only 8 percent of the entire line had been constructed; the completed pipe wouldn’t have gone online until next year at the earliest. The Keystone talking point likewise ignores that the Biden administration allowed the controversial Line 3 pipeline in Minnesota to finish construction and go online in the fall, allowing for ongoing transports of Alberta crude. So there’s little reason for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy or South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to be so upset. We’re not suffering for crude imports from Canada, anyway, in large part because tens of millions of barrels travel into the U.S. by rail. The Real Issue: Oil Companies Are Actually Just Trying to Pad Their Profits The real reason U.S. oil production hasn’t returned to peak production levels has less to do with Biden’s energy policies than with the fossil fuel industry’s desire to earn a buck. As demand for oil has resurged from its mid-2020 lows, producers have been under pressure from shareholders to “put profits over production increases” and “return cash to shareholders rather than pump it back into drilling,” to quote the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, respectively. As a result, companies have only expanded production slowly. Just listen to oil executives themselves. “Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans,” the CEO of Pioneer, which is the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the key oil-producing area of the Southwest, said at a Bloomberg event last month. “If the president wants us to grow, I just don’t think the industry can grow anyway.” Occidental Petroleum CEO Vicki Hollub has likewise said her company is focused on paying back investors at the moment: “I feel now that we do need to return cash to the shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks, especially during the better cycles.” Profit motives have held back oil production outside the U.S. too. OPEC countries hard hit from the recession kept a tight cap on output last fall—despite pressure from the U.S. and Japan and India to pump more—in order to goose their revenues. They only began to relent last week, when the United Arab Emirates announced it would increase production, leading prices to retreat a bit. As oil historian Gregory Brew told me last month, the UAE does have spare oil capacity at hand—and it doesn’t want continued high prices to potentially suppress global demand. Energy companies and oil-rich Middle Eastern monarchies aren’t the only ones cashing in. An L.A. Times report notes that some of the California gas stations that were charging $7 per gallon were setting their prices far above state and national averages because they found that desperate drivers were willing to pay—even if it hurts. Why All This Actually Sort of Matters Aside from political points scoring, why does any of this matter? Well, it has implications for a policy debate that’s unfolding in Washington. At the moment, the Biden administration is looking to secure new sources of oil to offset the loss of Russian crude, and has been talking to Iran and Venezuela about increasing production in return for reducing sanctions on those countries. But this move has triggered a bipartisan backlash from foreign policy hawks, who don’t want the U.S. doing business with either of those nations. Republicans have introduced a bill to ban the U.S. from purchasing oil from those countries, and have argued that Biden should be focused on increasing U.S. production instead. This position only makes sense if you think the Biden administration is holding the U.S. oil industry back. But the TL;DR here is that it is not Biden—it’s the drillers themselves who are holding it back. Oil prices have come down quite a bit in recent days thanks to various global developments, but they are still hovering above $100 a barrel. Unless our government is willing to do business with some unsavory regimes, American drivers are probably going to keep feeling pain at the pump. But as long as they’re blaming Biden, Republicans will probably be just fine with that."

On Wednesday, President Joe Biden extended the pause on student-loan payments, with waived interest, through August 31. This is the fourth time he's done so. He said in his announcement that borrowers should use the time to prepare to resume repayment, and while broad student-loan forgiveness was not mentioned, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, made clear it's not off the table. ""He has not ruled out, but I don't have any update on that,"" Psaki told a reporter who asked about the potential for broad loan forgiveness. ""And I would note that, again, he would encourage Congress to send him a bill canceling $10,000 in student debt, something that he talked about looking forward to signing on the campaign trail."" Psaki also noted earlier in the briefing that the administration will ""continue to assess"" whether payments should be paused beyond August 31. Leading up to the prior May 1 payment restart date, advocates and some Democratic lawmakers were not only pushing for a further extension of the pause, a lot of them wanted to see the relief carry over to at least next year as well as some form of student-debt cancellation. Other than his campaign pledge to approve $10,000 in forgiveness for every federal borrower, Biden himself has been largely silent on the issue, but Psaki has told reporters on numerous occasions that the issue now rests with Congress. Some lawmakers have taken the matter into their own hands. Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez introduced legislation in February to cancel $25,000 in student debt per borrower, and while he told Insider he thinks that amount could have potential to get bipartisan support, he also said that ""filing this bill is partly to call the attention to the administration that there's a promise you haven't fulfilled, and we expect you to do it."" Leading voices for broad debt cancellation, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have pushed back on introducing legislation, saying that doing so would take too long and would be unlikely to succeed because of partisanship in Congress. Still, whether Biden has the authority to cancel student debt broadly remains controversial. He asked the Education Department over a year ago to prepare a memo determining that authority, but redacted documents obtained by the Debt Collective revealed the memo has existed since April but has yet to be made public. And while Republicans remain adamant that Biden should not extend broad student-debt relief any further, Democrats are maintaining that he should, and he can. ""Last week, my colleagues & I led nearly 100 Members of Congress in urging @POTUS to extend the federal student loan payment pause & today the President heeded our calls,"" Warren wrote on Twitter. ""This extension is critical, but now is the time for the President to use his authority to #CancelStudentDebt."""

Russian President Vladimir Putin moved his forces to launch an internationally condemned invasion of Ukraine on February 24. The U.S., Canada and European allies have responded with stringent financial sanctions targeting the Russian economy as well as Putin and other Moscow elite. The Western nations have supplied Ukraine with substantial military and humanitarian aid as the Eastern European nation works to fight back. In a Wednesday live-streamed video address via Facebook, Greene raised concerns about the U.S. response to Ukraine. She warned against the U.S. moving toward a war with Russia, and contended that the U.S. was getting involved because prominent American leaders have ""direct financial interests"" there. In response, Cheney argued that Greene was pushing Putin's propaganda. ""Putin is targeting and slaughtering civilians in a brutal unprovoked war against Ukraine, a sovereign democratic nation,"" Cheney tweeted on Thursday morning. ""Only the Kremlin and their useful idiots would call that 'a conflict in which peace agreements have been violated by both sides.'"" The Kremlin is the fortified area in Moscow where Putin resides and governs. Greene said in the video: ""This is an 8-year-long smoldering conflict in which peace agreements have been routinely violated by both sides."" While Cheney and Greene are both Republicans, they represent distinctly different factions within the GOP. Cheney is staunchly opposed to former President Donald Trump, who has faced criticism for praising Putin as a ""genius"" as he launched the assault on Ukraine. Greene is one of the most outspoken Trump supporters in Congress and is widely seen as a key figure in the far-right ""America First"" or ""Make America Great Again"" movement. Just as Russia's invasion of Ukraine began at the end of February, Greene attended and gave a speech at the white nationalist America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC) in Florida. During that event, organizer Nick Fuentes led the crowd in chants supporting Putin. ""Can we give a round of applause for Russia?"" Fuentes asked the audience. After speaking at the event, Greene attempted to distance herself from Fuentes and his organization. She also condemned Putin and Russia's actions. ""In regards to Russia, Putin is a murderer and he should never have invaded Ukraine. What he is doing is completely wrong,"" Greene said when she was approached by a CBS News journalist over her appearance at the event. ""I stand with our NATO member allies and I'm completely against this war. Everything that he's doing is wrong. He's killing people over and over, so I'm staunchly against it and I'm staunchly against Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine."" Senator Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, condemned Greene and Representative Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican, who spoke via video link at the AFPAC event. ""Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar—I don't know them. But I'm reminded of that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid movie where one character says 'Morons. I have morons on my team.'

At her weekly press briefing, the House Democratic leader told reporters that she never believed that Mr Thomas should have joined the Supreme Court in the first place, and added that his wife had been revealed as a “admitted and proud contributor to a coup of our country”. The remarks were some of the sharpest criticism issued so far by a high ranking Democratic leader as the fallout over text messages Ginni Thomas sent to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows both prior to and following the January 6 attack continues. “Do you agree with members of your caucus that Clarence Thomas should resign?” a reporter asked Ms Pelosi. “I don’t think he ever should have been appointed in the first place,” she said, rolling her eyes slightly. Democrats opposed Mr Thomas’s confirmation after testimony from Anita Hill, a professor of law at Brandeis University, who accused Mr Thomas of sexual harassment. “I’m not going to go to that,” Ms Pelosi continued, referring to the question of whether Mr Thomas should resign. Later, she remarked about his considerations surrounding recusal on cases related to the January 6 attack on Congress. Mr Thomas previously has shown no indication that he will do so, and was the sole justice to rule in favour of shielding the White House’s communications — which may have included conversations between his wife and Donald Trump’s closest advisers — with the House select committee investigating the attack. “Well, if your wife is an admitted and proud contributor to a coup of our country, maybe you should weigh that in your ethical standards,” she quipped derisively. “We have a call for the Supreme Court to have a code of ethics. They don’t have a code of ethics...we don’t know what their ethical standard is,” Ms Pelosi added, referring to a Democrat-led effort to pass legislation establishing such a code of ethics enforced by federal law for the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s oldest justice after retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, Mr Thomas was recently released from the hospital after a week of care for an unspecified infection and spent several days recovering from home, participating in Court proceedings remotely. The 73-year-old’s condition was the centre of much speculation on social media, but little information has been released about his illness other than a statement from the Court confirming that he did not have Covid-19. His wife’s texts to Mark Meadows, the final White House chief of staff under Donald Trump, recently were made public as the January 6 committee’s efforts to obtain more of Mr Meadows text messages and other communications from White House aides from the hours and days surrounding the attack. They illuminated Ms Thomas’s role as a cheerleader and organiser of grassroots support for Mr Trump’s false claims about election fraud and his 2020 defeat to Mr Biden, and portrayed the wife of a sitting justice on the nation’s highest Court as a conspiracy-embracing political operative who was directly egging on an effort to overturn a fair election. The image of Ms Thomas coupled with her husband’s refusal to recuse himself on a case that is widely being condemned as a clear conflict of interest is dealing body blows to the public perception of the Court as an impartial, nonpolitical body and the ability of justices to police their own ethical procedures. A number of Democrats have written to Mr Thomas and the Court’s chief justice, John Roberts, demanding Mr Thomas’s recusal on January 6-related cases going forward while others like progressive Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have gone further and stated that Mr Thomas should leave the Court willingly or not."

Tulsi Gabbard, according to campaign finance records. Elena Branson, also known as Elena Chernykh, was charged this week with illegally promoting pro-Russia policies at the direction of top Kremlin officials without registering as a foreign agent, the Justice Department said Tuesday. Branson, who is accused of running a Russian ""propaganda center"" in New York for nearly a decade, only donated to Gabbard during that period, according to Federal Election Commission records first flagged by The Daily Beast. Branson made two small contributions in 2019 to Gabbard's presidential campaign for a combined total of $59.95, which even for a marginal candidate was insignificant. The Daily Beast observed that the donations ""raise questions about why an alleged Russian agent tasked with currying favor with U.S. politicians would zero in on Gabbard, and only Gabbard."" The DOJ complaint against Branson alleges that she targeted officials in Hawaii, which Gabbard represented in Congress at the time, on behalf of Russian officialsseeking to block a proposal to change the name of Russian Fort Elizabeth, a former Russian military installation on the island of Kauai (part of Gabbard's district), to its original Hawaiian name. The DOJ said that Branson provided Hawaiian officials with ""messages from Russian officials"" and also organized ""a trip for Hawaiian officials to Moscow to meet with high-ranking Russian Government personnel."" RELATED: Ex-Fox News director who helped Russian oligarch launch propaganda network arrested The lobbying effort involved communications with an unidentified member of Congress, ""Representative-1,"" according to the DOJ. An FBI agent's affidavit cited an email that Kauai County councilwoman Felicia Cowden forwarded to Branson in 2019 between Cowden and ""an individual working in the office of a member of the United States House of Representatives (Representative-1)."" Cowden asked the aide whether ""Representative-1"" would be interested in meeting an ""extraordinary group of people regarding Russian diplomacy,"" including Branson and ""two diplomats from the Russian embassy in Washington D.C."" Nine days after the email, Branson donated $49.95 to Gabbard's campaign. It's unclear whether Gabbard had any contact with Branson or Russian officials. Branson later organized a trip to Russia during which local Kauai officials met with Kremlin representatives. ""I am not coming or communicating because I am being watched. It feels wrong for me to be involved that way,"" Cowden wrote in a handwritten note to Branson, according to the DOJ. The park's name has not been changed. A spokesperson for Gabbard told the Daily Beast in a statement that she had been unaware of Branson's donations until the report. ""Congresswoman Gabbard's campaign has received thousands of contributions over the years, so she was not aware of Branson's miniscule [sic] contributions ($10 and $49.95) to Tulsi Now, nor is she aware of having any interaction with her,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Gabbard is ""not familiar with any park or fort or any other issues around this."" The spokesperson said Gabbard would donate the money to a charity that supports veterans ""because it appears that Branson may be acting as an agent for a foreign country,"" adding that law enforcement has not contacted Gabbard's team. Gabbard, who has long been accused of being an apologist for Russia and President Vladimir Putin, recently argued that Ukraine was not a real ""democracy"" and called for NATO to block Ukraine from joining to appease Putin's demands. Gabbard's presidential campaign was boosted by numerous Putin supporters and she previously met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a Putin ally, downplaying his responsibility for chemical attacks on civilians. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton alleged in 2019 that Russians were ""grooming"" Gabbard for a third-party run to hurt Democrats and had a ""bunch of sites and bots and others way of supporting her"" ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. Gabbard ultimately ran for president as a Democrat. She dropped out of the race in March 2020 after consistently polling at 1 to 2 percent and endorsed Joe Biden. But her controversial statements have made her a favorite of the pro-Trump right, and she has drawn praise from former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, white nationalist Richard Spencer, conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich and various online extremist groups. Branson, who fled the U.S. last year and has not been captured, had extensive ties to top Kremlin officials and ""corresponded with Putin himself,"" according to the Justice Department, amid a ""wide-ranging influence and lobbying scheme with funding and direction from the Russian government."" FBI official Michael Driscoll said Branson ran a ""campaign to identify the next generation of American leaders, cultivate information channels, and shape U.S. policy in favor of Russian objectives."" Branson was charged with six criminal counts, including failing to register as a foreign agent and making false statements to the FBI. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Branson tried to meet with then-candidate Donald Trump or his daughter Ivanka and invited them to her group's annual Russia Forum in New York at the behest of an unnamed Russian minister. Branson wrote in a message to Trump that if his ""busy schedule will not permit your attending our forum, perhaps you can suggest one of your children ... who have followed in your footsteps,"" prosecutors said in the complaint. ""There is no indication that the now-former President or his children attended the referenced meeting,"" prosecutors said. The outreach continued after Trump won the election. Days after he was declared the winner, Branson emailed an unnamed Trump adviser, inviting Trump to the World Chess Championship in New York and ""expressing congratulations for their victory in the presidential election,"" prosecutors said, adding that there is ""no indication the now-former President attended the referenced event."""

The Republican senator accused his ex-House counterpart, who served as a Democrat but has shifted far to the right since leaving office, of spreading “treasonous lies” that amounted to “Russian propaganda”. His statement came in reference to a video posted by Ms Gabbard that claimed the existence of “25 to 30” US-funded biolabs that she went on to assert “if breached would release & spread deadly pathogens to US/world”. There are a handful of Ukrainian-run biological threat analysis and defence labs in Ukraine, but there’s no evidence to suggest that they are working on biological weapons as far-right commentators and the Russian government have claimed. It’s also not a certainty that the labs would release dangerous pathogens if damaged in the ongoing conflict, as experts have worked to destroy any dangerous substances on site. The US and Ukrainian governments have both denied the existence of bioweapons facilities in Ukraine. Ms Gabbard did not assert the existence of bioweapons in Ukraine or anywhere else, but did suggest in her video that the labs contained dangerous pathogens that would be released accidentally if the sites were attacked. She did, however, expand her criticism to US-funded biomedical research around the world, pointing to the hundreds of research facilities funded by the US to research and cure dangerous diseases. The former congresswoman would go on to claim that all such laboratories were conducting “dangerous research” and should be shut down. “Now, after realising how dangerous and vulnerable these labs are, they should have all been shut down two years ago,” she claimed. The Ukrainian government directed all such labs in the country to dispose of any samples of pathogens following the beginning of Russia’s invasion, an action the Department of Defense said “limit[s] the danger of an accidental release of pathogens”. It wasn’t clear what particular claim that Ms Gabbard was making amounted to what Mr Romney called “false Russian propaganda”. “Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives,” Mr Romney’s tweet read in full. The Independent has reached out to the former congresswoman for comment. While Ms Gabbard did not directly accuse the US of nefarious purposes in funding the labs operated by Ukraine’s government, the narrative plays into the hands of the Russian government, according to US officials, given that the Biden administration has said in recent days that their Russian counterparts are spreading false claims about supposed US-supported manufacturing of bioweapons in Ukraine which US officials say could be pretext to the deployment of chemical or biological weapons by Russia’s military in its bloody onslaught through Ukrainian territory. Russia’s invasion has already reportedly killed thousands of civilians and US officials are now openly warning that the use of chemical or biological weapons by Moscow would escalate the conflict significantly. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned on Sunday that the Biden administration would make Russia pay a “steep price” if chemical or biological weapons were used in Ukraine, but did not define what specific punishment Moscow would face. The White House has remained firm that US or Nato troops will not be used to defend Ukrainian territory."

The Washington Post and CBS News obtained dozens of texts that Ginni Thomas, a long-time far-right activist who attended the January 6 rally that preceded the Capitol assault, sent to Meadows in the wake of Trump's election loss, which she characterized as fraudulent while her husband was hearing election-related cases. ""Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down,"" Thomas wrote in a November 19 message to Meadows, echoing a slogan that served as a rallying cry for pro-Trump groups. All but one of the texts between Thomas and Meadows, most of which were written by Thomas, were sent between November 4 and November 24, 2020. One text was sent on January 10, 2021 in the wake of the Capitol insurrection. Justice Thomas, who is currently hospitalized with an infection, has thus far declined to recuse himself from Supreme Court cases in which his wife's right-wing activism could pose a conflict of interest. Thomas was the only justice to publicly argue that the high court should have granted former President Donald Trump's motion to block the National Archives from handing White House documents over to a congressional panel investigating the January 6 attack. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected Trump's request. Sarah Lipton-Lubet, executive director of the Take Back the Court Action Fund, said in a statement Thursday night that ""if one thing is clear"" from the newly revealed text messages, ""it's that there's much more to the story of Ginni Thomas' participation in the January 6 attack that the House Select Committee and the American public deserve to know."" ""Given that Justice Thomas has already made known he won't recuse himself from cases related to his wife's right-wing activism, and the damning evidence of his wife's involvement in this attack on our democracy, Thomas is clearly unfit to serve on the nation's highest court,"" said Lipton-Lubet. ""Clarence Thomas must immediately resign from his seat on the Supreme Court."" ""If he refuses, Congress must move to impeach him,"" she added. ""The integrity of the court, our judicial system, and our democracy as a whole depends on it."" At least one member of Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), echoed the call for Thomas' impeachment. The House can impeach a Supreme Court justice with a simple-majority vote, but a two-thirds majority is required in the Senate for conviction and removal. At the very least, the new revelations demonstrate why Thomas ""must recuse from any Supreme Court cases or petitions related to the January 6 Committee or efforts to overturn the election,"" argued Gabe Roth, executive director of the nonpartisan advocacy group Fix the Court.""Ginni's direct participation in this odious anti-democracy work, coupled with the new reporting that seems to indicate she may have spoken to Justice Thomas about it, leads to the conclusion that the justice's continued participation in cases related to these efforts would only further tarnish the court's already fading public reputation,"" Roth said. TheNew Yorker's Jane Mayer reported in January that Ginni Thomas has in recent years aligned herself ""with many activists who have brought issues in front of"" the Supreme Court. ""She has been one of the directors of CNP Action, a dark-money wing of the conservative pressure group the Council for National Policy,"" Mayer noted. ""CNP Action, behind closed doors, connects wealthy donors with some of the most radical right-wing figures in America. Ginni Thomas has also been on the advisory board of Turning Point USA, a pro-Trump student group, whose founder, Charlie Kirk, boasted of sending busloads of protesters to Washington on January 6th."" Mayer also observed that Ginni Thomas received payments from the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a right-wing anti-Muslim think tank. Despite disclosure requirements, Justice Thomas failed to report his wife's income from CSP in 2017 and 2018. In an op-ed published before the text messages between Ginni Thomas and Meadows surfaced, MSNBC's Mehdi Hasan cited Mayer's reporting to argue that ""Democrats should be loudly drawing attention to the fact that the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice supported Trump's coup attempt."" ""There is a clear value in holding impeachment hearings to draw attention to Thomas and his wife and their inappropriate behavior, especially as an increasingly partisan, conservative-majority court guts voting and reproductive rights,"" Hasan wrote. ""What would Republicans be doing if they had held a House majority and, say, Justice Sonia Sotomayor's spouse had supported attempts to block a duly elected GOP president from taking office and she refused to recuse herself from related cases?"""

Amy Klobuchar demands Justice Thomas recuse himself from future election cases over his wife's texts,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar called for Associate Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from elections cases. It follows the release of damning text messages from Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court justice's wife. Ginni Thomas exchanged dozens of texts with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, urging him to overturn the 2020 election. She also pushed outlandish conspiracy theories that members of the ""Biden crime family,"" along with ""ballot fraud co-conspirators,"" were sent to Guantánamo Bay to face military trials for sedition. A total of 29 text messages were exchanged between Thomas and Meadows from November 2020 to January 2021, CNN first reported on Thursday. The messages were obtained from Meadows by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. ""Do not concede. It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back,"" Thomas wrote to Meadows, according to The Washington Post. In another message sent on November 10, 2020, days after the major news networks declared then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 election, Thomas wrote to Meadows: ""Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!"" ""You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America's constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History,"" the text continued, per The Post. ""This is unbelievable. You have the wife of a sitting Supreme Court justice advocating for an insurrection, advocating for overturning a legal election to the sitting president's chief of staff, and she also knows this election, these cases, are going to come before her husband. This is a textbook case for removing him, recusing him from these decisions,"" Klobuchar said on ABC News ""This Week."" Earlier this month, Thomas said she ""played no role with those who were planning and leading the Jan. 6 events."" Though Thomas is actively involved in politics and her husband sits on the nation's highest court, she told the Free Beacon that the couple has ""our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too."" ""Clarence doesn't discuss his work with me, and I don't involve him in my work,"" she said. The Minnesota Democrat added: ""All I hear is silence from the Supreme Court right now, and that better change in the coming week because every other federal judge in the country, except Supreme Court justices, would have guidance from ethics rules that says you got to recuse himself."" Klobuchar issued a calling from stricter ethics rules for the Supreme Court, which currently is beholden to no such code of conduct because Congress has not created ethics rules for it. However, the Court could create rules for itself. ""The entire integrity of the court is on the line here, and they had better speak out on this because you cannot have a justice hearing cases related to this election,"" Klobuchar said. ""So not only should he recuse himself, but this Supreme Court badly needs ethics rules."" Klobuchar did not say what would happen if Thomas refuses to recuse himself from future election cases. The associate justice has recused himself once before, from a 1996 case involving sex discrimination at the Virginia Military Institute, where Thomas' son was a student at the time."

Florida’s Republican-controlled state legislature passed the widely criticised measure – which has been nicknamed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – on 8 March after six hours of debate. The bill forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. It has been met with a huge backlash from critics who argue it risks marginalising LGBTQ+ people. Republican governor DeSantis signed the bill into law on Monday 28 March. “Good morning Governor DeSantis, Ron here,” the Hellboy and Sons of Anarchy actor can be heard saying in a video tweeted on Tuesday (29 March). “Don’t say gay? Don’t say?” he continues. “As the first two words in a sentence spoken by a political leader of a state in the United States of America. Don’t say? Don’t f***ing say you f***ing Nazi pig? Say! First amendment. Read about it. Then run for office. You piece of s***.” Before signing the bill, DeSantis said: “We will make sure parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.” His move was criticised by US President Joe Biden, who said: “Our LGBTQI+ youth deserve to be affirmed and accepted just as they are.” This is not the first time Perlman has hit out at a Republican politician. Earlier this month, Perlman criticised Texas senator Ted Cruz for questioning Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman and the first former public defender to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a Supreme Court justice nominee, on critical race theory."

According to polling results released by the League of Conservation Voters, 80% of U.S. voters--including 73% of Republicans--support ""placing a windfall profits tax on the extra profits oil companies are making from the higher gasoline prices they are charging because of the Russia-Ukraine situation."" More broadly, 87% of U.S. voters want Congress and President Joe Biden to ""crack down on price gouging and excessive price increases by oil companies that result in higher gas prices at the pump."" Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, said in a statement Friday that the survey data shows voters ""know who is to blame for high gas prices: Big Oil."" ""For politicians on both sides of the aisle, this polling is proof that their constituents overwhelmingly support the idea of a windfall profits tax that would stop Big Oil profiteering and send relief directly to consumers,"" Henn added. ""If members of Congress refuse to act, it'll be concrete evidence that they're in the pockets of the industry."" The fresh polling came days after a group of House and Senate Democrats unveiled legislation that would hit large, highly profitable oil companies with ""a per-barrel tax equal to 50% of the difference between the current price of a barrel of oil and the pre-pandemic average price per barrel between 2015 and 2019."" ""Revenue raised from the windfall profits of big oil companies will be returned to consumers in the form of a quarterly rebate, which would phase out for single filers who earn more than $75,000 in annual income and joint filers who earn more than $150,000,"" according to a summary released by the office of Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the bill's lead sponsor in the House. After an initial surge following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, oil prices have fallen in recent days--but gas prices in the U.S. have remained elevated, bolstering the narrative that corporate profiteering is driving up costs at the pump. ""Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too,"" President Joe Biden wrote in a Twitter post on Wednesday. ""Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it's $4.31. Oil and gas companies shouldn't pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, echoed the president's message. ""Once more for the people in the back: rising oil prices are being caused by corporate greed,"" Jayapal wrote."

Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a longtime conservative activist, texted Meadows in the days after the 2020 election, according to the messages obtained by the House Committee investigating January 6 and reported on by the Washington Post's Bob Woodward and CBS News' Robert Costa. ""Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators (elected officials, bureaucrats, social media censorship mongers, fake stream media reporters, etc) are being arrested & detained for ballot fraud right now & over coming days, & will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition,"" Thomas wrote in a message on November 5, 2020, two days after the presidential election, according to the Post. Adherents of the Q-Anon conspiracy movement spread those and similar conspiracy theories throughout late 2020 and early 2021, falsely claiming online that officials including Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff had been rounded up in mass arrests, sent to Guantánamo, and executed for treason. No Biden allies, elected officials, bureaucrats, or journalists were ever sent to Guantánamo or put on trial for sedition in connection to the 2020 election. Thomas espoused QAnon-adjacent theories in many of the nearly 30 texts reported on by the Post. The first message Thomas sent Meadows referenced a since-removed YouTube video from Steve Pieczenik, a conspiracy theorist who has previously espoused the baseless theory that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a ""false flag"" operation meant to gin up support for gun restrictions. In another message reported by the Post, Thomas referenced a popular QAnon theory that Trump had deliberately ""watermarked"" mail ballots to find potential voter fraud. ""Watermarked ballots in over 12 states have been part of a huge Trump & military white hat sting operation in 12 key battleground states,"" she said. The partisan review of the 2020 election results in Maricopa County, Arizona commissioned by the state Senate and conducted by the now-defunct firm Cyber Ninjas searched for such marks, but failed to uncover any evidence of ballots being watermarked. In other texts, Thomas urged Meadows not to concede the election, privately trashed Republicans in Congress, rallied behind controversial lawyer Sidney Powell, and told Meadows to ""Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down."" A New York Times story in February reported that Thomas had been involved in the planning of the rallies on January 6, including playing a ""uniting"" role between different rally organizers. Thomas downplayed her connection to January 6 rally organizers in an interview with the Washington Free Beacon and said she left the Save America rally before Trump's speech because of the cold weather. But the texts show her deep interest in trying to overturn the 2020 election — in addition to her fervent belief in conspiracy theories that originated with the QAnon movement."

CNN first reported on Friday that Trump Jr. sent a November 5, 2020 text message to Meadows which said: ""It's very simple ... We have multiple paths We control them all."" The former president's son reportedly laid out plans to subvert the Electoral College process and keep his father, former President Donald Trump, in the White House. Notably, that message was sent just two days after the election—before the results were finalized and as many states continued to count ballots. Trump Jr.'s attorney Alan S. Futerfas told CNN that the message was most likely forwarded. ""After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded,"" he said. But Trump critics and some legal experts jumped on the reporting, arguing it was more evidence of a ""coup"" attempt. ""What this makes clear is that Jan. 6 was not based on a belief, good faith or otherwise, that the outcome of the 2020 election was decided incorrectly—they were plotting this before the votes had even been counted! The coup was the plan from the get-go,"" Asha Rangappa, a lawyer and senior lecturer at Yale University as well as a former FBI special agent, tweeted on Friday. Laurence Tribe, a professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard, agreed with Rangappa's assessment. "".@AshaRangappa_ has this just right,"" Tribe wrote, retweeting the lawyer's post. ""Most others have missed this key point: Junior's revelations kill the 'innocent state of mind' defense, leaving compelling proof of corrupt intent for each of the several federal felonies the plotters close to the defeated president committed."" Glenn Kirschner, a former U.S. Army prosecutor who has repeatedly called for Trump's indictment, touted the text messages as evidence of ""treasonous criminality."" ""The 'Subject' line of Don Jr.'s email might as well have been, 'I'm a member of my father's criminal conspiracy to overturn the election.' How long do we have to endure this open, treasonous criminality by Trump and company before someone gets indicted?"" Kirschner wrote in a Twitter post. Trump has consistently rejected any wrongdoing related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of January 6, 2021—when hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and threatened the lives of top lawmakers, including Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The former president continues to claim that President Joe Biden's victory was fraudulent and that any investigations into him and his family are politically motivated. The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack against the Capitol said in a March court filing that evidence suggests Trump and his allies engaged in a ""criminal conspiracy"" related to the 2020 election. The committee contended that the former president and ""several others entered into an agreement to defraud the United States by interfering with the election certification process, disseminating false information about election fraud, and pressuring state officials to alter state election results and federal officials to assist in that effort."" U.S. District Court Judge David Carter appeared to agree that Trump may have engaged in criminality. ""Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021,"" Carter wrote in a late March ruling. Despite Trump's and his allies claims, no evidence has emerged to corroborate allegations of widespread fraud resulting in his election loss. Dozens of 2020 election challenge lawsuits filed by Trump and his allies failed in state and federal courts. Even judges appointed by the former president consistently dismissed the lawsuits. Meanwhile, audits and recounts—including in states where the election was overseen by pro-Trump conservatives—have repeatedly reaffirmed Biden's win. Former Attorney General William Barr, who was widely viewed as one of Trump's most loyal cabinet members, has said repeatedly that there is ""no evidence"" to support allegations of widespread voter fraud. Barr wrote in his memoir published last month that he told Trump to his face that the claims were ""bullish*t."""

Still, his Cedar Hill Farms is a frequent location for GOP fundraisers despite his lackluster results at the ballot box and his extremist positions. Foster, who authored the state’s death penalty law, took to social media to proclaim that transgender people should be executed by firing squad. The law he wrote allows for the state to use the barbaric method too. “Some of y’all still want to try and find political compromise with those that want to groom our school aged children and pretend men are women, etc,” Foster tweeted. “I think they need to be lined up against [a] wall before a firing squad to be sent to an early judgment.” “I said what I said,” he followed up. “The law should be changed so that anyone trying to sexually groom children and/or advocating to put men pretending to be women in locker rooms and bathrooms with young women should receive the death penalty by firing squad.” Spencer Ritchie, the former head of the state party, tweeted in response, “The fascist force is strong with this one.” “Spineless establishment RINOs like you have conceded every fight with the Communists when you held power,” Foster replied. “Ya’ll ‘Conservatives’ haven’t actually conserved anything. Now the Godless have power and they are destroying our country. Soon we will have to deal with this directly.” The tweets have since been deleted for violating Twitter’s rules. During his gubernatorial campaign, Foster refused to allow female journalists to ride on his campaign bus as male journalists did. He won less than 18% of the primary vote when even Mississippi Republicans found him too extreme."

Mo Brooks of Alabama said on Wednesday that former President Donald Trump pressed him to illegally remove President Joe Biden from office and hold a new presidential election, moves that are both unconstitutional. ""President Trump asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency,"" Brooks said in a statement responding to Trump's withdrawal of his endorsement of Brooks' US Senate campaign. In a statement on Wednesday, Trump said Brooks had gone ""woke"" by asking him to move beyond his repeatedly debunked claims about the 2020 election. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. If Brooks' claims are true, they would fit within a pattern of Trump pressing elected officials to overturn the result of the 2020 election. Former Vice President Mike Pence recently said Trump was ""wrong"" to suggest that Pence could have unilaterally rejected a state's electoral votes when lawmakers met to certify them on January 6, 2021. Trump's calls have even inspired fringe efforts to ""decertify"" results in an apparent bid to somehow claw back electoral votes. There is no precedent for such action. Each state's electors met on December 14, 2020. Their results were sent to Congress, and lawmakers met on January 6, 2021, to formally count the votes. Biden was declared the winner, and, per the Constitution, he was inaugurated on January 20, 2021. Removing Biden from power would be the definition of a coup d'état. There is no such thing as a ""special election for the presidency."" Brooks said Trump withdrew his endorsement in part because of these disagreements. The congressman was once the frontrunner in the GOP contest to replace Sen. Richard Shelby but has fallen behind in polls and struggled to raise money. By all accounts, Trump does not like endorsing losing candidates. ""I've told President Trump the truth knowing full well that it might cause President Trump to rescind his endorsement,"" Brooks said. ""But I took a sworn oath to defend and protect the U.S. Constitution. I honor my oath. That is the way I am. I break my sworn oath for no man."""
/r/politics/comments/ty2hkc/lawmakers_propose_putting_violent_passengers_on_a/,1649297687,https://www.ktvu.com/news/lawmakers-propose-putting-violent-passengers-on-a-no-fly-list-for-life,45393,Lawmakers propose putting violent passengers on a no-fly list for life,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Two U.S. lawmakers are proposing a new bill that would place violent flight passengers on a lifetime commercial no-fly list managed by the Transportation Security Administration. The ""Protection from Abusive Passengers Act,"" proposed by U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) and U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), aims to ""improve air travel safety, increase traveler protections, reduce the number of in-flight violent incidents, and hold unruly passengers accountable."" In addition to being placed on a no-fly list, convicted violent passengers would also permanently be banned from participating in the TSA PreCheck or Customs' Global Entry programs. Unruly violent passengers would be first given a notice from the TSA and an opportunity to appeal before being placed on the permanent no-fly list, said Swalwell told KTVU on Tuesday This would be a civil penalty; passengers could also be subject to any local criminal prosecutions. Cher Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, said she relished the idea of the bill. ""A lot of us are afraid to come to work,"" Taylor said. ""I'll be perfectly honest because we share stories."" She was involved in a racially motivated fight on a plane that started off with words, but then turned physical. It's hard, she said, as a flight attendant to catch a situation before it goes too far, but that's often very difficult. The proposal comes in the same week that Southwest passenger faces federal charges after allegedly masturbating on a flight from Seattle to Phoenix and month after the FBI sent 80 unruly airline passenger cases to the Department of Justice for possible criminal  prosecution. SEE ALSO: Southwest passenger arrested for masturbating 4 times during flight ""Most of us who fly don't have to worry about this,"" Swalwell said in an interview. ""But too many flights have at least one person who's been acting out and risking the safety of everyone on board, and is high time that we have real consequences for."" Currently, passengers are subject to $36,516 of civil penalties for misconduct on a flight, Swalwell's office told KTVU. Passengers who assault or intimidate a crewmember could be subjected to criminal fines and imprisonment for up to 20 years. This is not the first time a no-fly list was proposed. In February, Delta Airlines wrote to the U.S. Department of Justice requesting that any person convicted of a disruption on board a flight should be put on a national ""no fly"" list. But it didn't pass. A group eight GOP senators issued a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland saying while they ""strongly condemn any violence towards airline workers,"" they also feel a ""strong opposition to the creation of such a list."" Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Rick Scott, R-Fla., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Mike Lee, R-Utah, James Lankford, R-Okla., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took issue with the request, in part because it would target those who are skeptical of mask mandates. ""Creating a federal ‘no-fly’ list for unruly passengers who are skeptical of this mandate would seemingly equate them to terrorists who seek to actively take the lives of Americans and perpetrate attacks on the homeland,"" the senators wrote in part. As of Monday, there were 1,081 reports of unruly passenger incidents reported, roughly 65% of them were mask-related incidents, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Enforcement actions were taken in only 159 of those reported cases. The rate of unruly passenger incidents per 10,000 flights has decreased significantly, from 6.9 incidents per 10,000 flights in Dec. 2021 to 3.8 incidents in March of this year, according to FAA data."

Mike Braun says Supreme Court was wrong to legalize interracial marriage,"The U.S. Supreme Court was wrong to legalize interracial marriage, Indiana Sen. Mike Braun, a Republican, argued on Tuesday. Suggesting the historic Loving v. Virginia ruling by the Supreme Court decades ago was a case of improper judicial activism, Braun said the court should have left that decision to the individual states, including those which had already outlawed interracial marriage. ""When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings, they're going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do,"" Braun told reporters. ""It's the beauty of the system, and that's where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves."" The Republican's larger point was to publicly dissuade President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, away from what he described as ""activist"" behavior from the bench. ""She seems well-qualified. But whenever I vote for a Supreme Court justice it's going to be, basically, how are you going to interpret the law,"" Braun said. ""If your record shows that you're going to be kind of an activist there, I don't think that's good, and I don't think the Founders intended it that way."" He continued: ""Stick with interpreting the law. Don't legislate from the bench."" Braun then disapprovingly pointed to the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide. Pressed by a reporter on if he similarly disapproved of the decision to federally legalize interracial marriage, Braun said he did. ""If you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too,"" Braun said. ""I think that's hypocritical."" Braun went on to tell a Times of Northwest Indiana reporter that he is also open to the Supreme Court rescinding its 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling establishing a right to privacy on contraceptive use. ""You can list a whole host of issues,"" Braun said. ""When it comes down to whatever they are, I'm going to say they're not going to all make you happy within a given state. But we're better off having states manifest their points of view, rather than homogenizing it across the country as Roe v. Wade did."" The Republican later tried to clean up his remarks. ""Let me be clear on that issue — there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities or individuals,"" Braun said."

Mr Cruz made the comments on Monday evening on Fox News, speaking with the network’s Sean Hannity. “Joe Biden caused this war with Ukraine. How did he do it? When he waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2, sanctions that I authored, that I wrote, that Donald Trump signed into law,” Mr Cruz charged. He went on to falsely imply that the Nord Stream 2 project had been completed “to let Putin get his gas to Europe”. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline finished construction in September after Mr Biden waived sanctions at Germany’s request, but the pipeline itself never became operational, and may well never be used following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which has caused the project to fall into the sights of the White House. Mr Cruz’s comments drew a handful of reactions on Twitter, but the Texas senator’s recent flurry of appearances on Fox News have thus far not made a major impact on social media. What has, however, was a tweet from a reporter attending the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson, who spotted the Republican on his phone checking reactions to his performance at the hearings while they were still ongoing. “Putin ALONE is responsible for attacking a sovereign country and the human rights atrocities now occurring,” wrote one woman who identified herself as a Texan on Twitter in response. “Nordstream 2 which hasn't been finished and has not moved any natural gas to Germany and has been basically shut down by Germany???” wrote another. Mr Biden has vowed publicly that the Nord Stream 2 project will not go forward as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Germany’s chancellor suspended certification of the project in February, halting all work. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has described the now-halted project as a “geopolitical weapon” in Russia’s arsenal, and he has personally faulted Germany on several occasions for decisions he believes gave Russia the confidence to invade. “We always said Nord Stream 2 is a weapon and a preparation for the great war, and we got the answer that it was business, business, business,” he told Germany’s parliament in a stern speech in March. Adding of Germany’s reluctance to join the US and other western nations in full-throated opposition to Russia, he continued during that speech: “When we appealed for preventative sanctions, we turned to you … but we felt the delay, the resistance ... We’ve understood: You want business, business, business.”"

In tweets posted on Friday, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued, with cities besieged and bombarded, Adam Kinzinger said: “I want to be honest, in Congress I have only a few votes that in hinds[igh]t, I regret. My biggest regret was voting against the first impeachment of Donald Trump. “It’s important for political leaders to be transparent and admit regret when needed. The bottom line, Donald Trump withheld lethal aid to Ukraine so he could use it as leverage for his campaign. This is a shameful and illegal act, directly hurting the Ukraine defense today. “I wish I could go back in time and vote for it, but I cannot. What we can do now is to ensure that this never happens again, and that we all put the interests of our nation above our party. Alexander Vindman [a White House official who was fired for opposing Trump’s Ukraine scheme] and others deserve our appreciation.” No House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the Ukraine scandal, which saw only the Utah senator Mitt Romney vote to convict in the Senate. Kinzinger, from Illinois, was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for inciting the deadly Capitol attack. Kinzinger is also among such Republicans who have announced that they will retire at the next election, rather than face a Trump-anointed challenger. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the other Republican on the January 6 committee, faces such a primary challenge. She also voted not to impeach Trump over Ukraine but to impeach him over the Capitol riot. Trump is in legal jeopardy over January 6, his attempts to overturn the election and his business affairs. But he still dominates the Republican party and polling of possible presidential nominees in 2024. He has hinted heavily and repeatedly that he will indeed run. In response to Kinzinger’s tweets, Edward Luce of the Financial Times said he “want[ed] to hear more as it can’t be that you were ignorant of the facts or of the nature of Trump”. Luce added: “It’s always admirable to admit mistakes … it would be an even greater service to hear about the psychology of such politics as most of his colleagues are still acting that way.” Kinzinger did not immediately elaborate. His party remains home to politicians who have praised Vladimir Putin, not least Trump himself. The former president has repeatedly praised the Russian president for being smart, though he has condemned the Ukraine war. On Thursday night, Trump repeatedly rebuffed attempts by the Fox News host Sean Hannity to get him to say Putin was “evil” or an “enemy”. Another House Republican, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, a prominent Trump supporter, was reported this week to have called the president of Ukraine, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, a “thug” and his government “incredibly evil”. On Twitter, Kinzinger said: “This is the sad but successful impact of Russia’s cyber operation that we’ve seen pushed and promoted on conservative outlets. The threat is real and it’s dangerous. Case in point: a sitting US congressman is echoing Putin propaganda.”"
/r/politics/comments/thz32q/i_did_the_work_and_now_i_want_the_job_stacey/,1647707888,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/19/politics/stacey-abrams-one-georgia-gubernatorial-bid/index.html,44720,I did the work and now I want the job‚Äô: Stacey Abrams kicks second bid for Georgia governor into high gear,"Warner Robins, GeorgiaCNN — On a sunny Monday afternoon on the deck of a lakeside restaurant in central Georgia, a packed crowd of Stacey Abrams supporters eagerly awaited her arrival. When Abrams strode in with her powder blue jacket, the crowd leapt to their feet and cheered. “I want us to be one Georgia where your zip code and your income don’t determine your quality of life,” said Abrams. The crowd – which included a school administrator, a teacher and several veterans listened as Abrams praised the work of a nearby prominent homeless shelter and asked for a moment of silence to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine. “The issue of preserving democracy is one of scale and of intent,” she said. “And we are responsible for doing our small part here. And we should be led by the example of the atrocities that are happening there.” Abrams’s second bid for governor kicked into high gear this week with a slew of rallies and meet-and-greets as part of her “One Georgia” tour. Abrams met with Georgians up and down the state, from Cuthbert to Atlanta. In the years since the 2018 gubernatorial election, Abrams never stopped running for the job. As she tells it, she’s spent the time doing the work for the people of Georgia. Last year, the Fair Fight Political Action Committee, under Abrams leadership, announced they donated more than $1 million dollars to the organization RIP Medical Debt to eliminate medical bills owed by thousands across the South. She also touted her voter engagement efforts and her advocacy to ensure marginalized communities were counted in the 2020 Census. “I did the work and now I want the job,” she told a crowd in Atlanta. Her second candidacy comes at a time when much will be on the line in Georgia. While now-President Joe Biden won the state narrowly four years ago – followed by two Senate runoff victories that rewarded Democrats control of the Senate – the state remains in play. In addition to the gubernatorial race, it will host one of the marquee Senate races in the fall, with Sen. Raphael Warnock defending his seat. And voters statewide will soon experience the provisions laid out in the elections law passed by Republican state lawmakers last year, from limited drop boxes and shortened runoffs to changes to absentee voting and the restriction of offering food and drinks to people waiting in line to vote. As for Abrams, she could end up in a historic rematch against Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is engaged in a bitter primary contest with former Sen. David Perdue. “I think she started this race four years ago and she’s been building a career and a value system all this time. She’s right on schedule,” said Donata Defilippi, a supporter at her Atlanta rally. Her pitch to voters includes little mention of the last election and instead focuses primarily on her plan to expand Medicaid, recover from the Covid pandemic, shore up broadband in rural communities and invest in education. Still, the 48-year-old’s narrow 2018 loss against Kemp still haunts many of her backers. And Abrams’ action after that loss – when she acknowledged Kemp would be certified as governor but refused to concede, attributing her defeat to voter suppression – has become something she’s had to address as well. “I believe it was really unfair. She was robbed pretty much,” said Stacey Rice, a 62-year-old retired veteran at the event in Warner Robins. That sentiment was later echoed by a woman in the crowd during a question-and-answer session with Abrams. The woman asked why Abrams decided to run again. “When you apply for a job, and you very publicly don’t get it, it can be a little hard,” Abrams said. “Through no fault of your own, it was stolen,” the woman replied. “No. We’re not going to do that. Ya’ll are just trying to start trouble. Stop it. The election is over and when that election was over, I was not the governor. I did not win,” Abrams answered before steering the conversation back to the central themes of her campaign. Though Democrats are anticipated to face a tough midterm election year battle – historically, the party in power suffers losses – Abrams has honed in on local issues, offering a roadmap for what she thinks is a winning playbook. She’s confident the strength of her own brand in Georgia can overcome the national landscape her party must confront. And with the benefit of not having to face a primary challenger, she can begin crafting her message for the general election early. When Abrams was asked by CNN if she was concerned the inability of Washington Democrats to pass signature legislation on voting rights and police reform would impact her bid for governor, she suggested Democrats had to explain to voters how long these policies take to advance and shouldn’t be faulted for having ambitious goals. “We should do the big things, the tough things, the hard things but we should also be honest about how long it’s going to take. My responsibility as I run for governor is not to distance myself from the hard things. It’s to talk about how we get the hard things done,” she responded. “I’m not concerned about that,” she added. Though Abrams is deliberately aiming to keep the race state focused, Republicans will use her national aspirations and celebrity status against her. She’s best known throughout the country for being the strategic mastermind behind the sustained voter engagement strategy that ultimately led to those Democratic victories in January 2021’s Georgia runoffs. Abrams was also candid about her interest in being Biden’s running mate in 2020. “Stacey Abrams may see the Governor’s Mansion as the next stepping stone on her way to the White House, but Georgians won’t be fooled,” Kemp press secretary Tate Mitchell said in a statement this month. Though Kemp enjoys the power of incumbency, he is facing a formidable primary challenger in Perdue who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump. Trump erroneously argues Kemp did not do enough to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and by extension the issue has become definitive of Perdue’s campaign. Later this month, Trump will travel to Georgia to hold a rally for Perdue in Commerce. But even as the GOP primary poses a challenge for the sitting governor, Kemp seems to spend more time attacking Abrams directly. “At this point, David Perdue’s campaign is nothing more than an in-kind contribution to Stacey Abrams. While the former senator continues to run a failing campaign, Governor Kemp will remain focused on uniting Republicans behind a record of results and beating Abrams this fall,” said Cody Hall, Kemp’s director of communications and senior adviser, in a statement earlier this month."

It is especially timely given Vladimir Putin and Russia's war on Ukraine. Robert McNamara, who was secretary of defense under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s and one of the chief architects of the disastrous war in Vietnam, is the film's subject. If you let people talk, they will show you who they really are. Morris demonstrates great skill at allowing villains to speak for themselves, and in doing so to reveal their complexity — and their sincere belief in their own victimhood and heroism. ""The Fog of War"" is a masterclass in that lesson, one which all interviewers and those others who use words for a living should internalize.In the film, McNamara tells this story from his World War II past: The U.S. Air Force had a new airplane named the B-29. The B-17s and B-24s in Europe bombed from 15,000, 16,000 feet. The problem was they were subject to anti-aircraft fire and to fighter aircraft. To relieve that, this B-29 was being developed that bombed from high altitude and it was thought we could destroy targets much more efficiently and effectively. I was brought back from the 8th Air Force and assigned to the first B-29s, the 58th Bomb Wing. We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India. Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China. The airfields were built with Chinese labor. It was an insane operation. I can still remember hauling these huge rollers to crush the stone and make them flat. A long rope, somebody would slip. The roller would roll over [that person], everybody would laugh and go on. That story of laughter and death and numbness applies to America's current situation as well. Former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham recently told ""The View"" that Donald Trump wanted the power to kill with impunity. In explaining why Trump both admired and feared Vladimir Putin she said: I think he was afraid of him. I think that the man intimidated him. Because Putin is a scary man, just frankly, I think he was afraid of him…. I also think he admired him greatly. I think he wanted to be able to kill whoever spoke out against him. So I think it was a lot of that. In my experience with him, he loved the dictators, he loved the people who could kill anyone, including the press. A healthy society would have been stunned, disgusted, terrified and moved to action by Grisham's confession. The evident fact that Trump is a sociopath would have been the subject of extensive news coverage. If America were a healthy society, we would have an ongoing ""national conversation"" about the peril the country experienced from Trump, his Republican-fascist allies and their movement — danger that has only grown stronger. A healthy society would now ask: How can we prevent another Donald Trump, another fascistic, sadistic demagogue, from ever coming to power? What does it say about American society that Donald Trump and his cabal of coup plotters and other enemies of democracy and freedom have not been punished? That they are plotting in public how overthrow American democracy and return Trump to power without fear of punishment or other negative consequences? And that Trump still has many tens of millions of followers — many of whom are potentially willing to engage in acts of violence, and perhaps even die, at his command? What does that say about a country and a people? What was the response to Grisham's comments about Donald Trump's desire to commit murder? Silence and indifference. Neither the media nor the American people seem to care. They have become desensitized to what not long ago would have been judged unconscionable. America is a pathocracy. The masses take their cues from corrupted elites. Malignant normality is the new normal. Political deviance has been normalized. The Age of Trump constantly offers further proof that a sick and broken society can accept just about anything, no matter how surreal and grotesque Fascism thrives in such societies. But the poison could not have spread so quickly if the soil and foundations were not toxic to begin with. It is not adequate simply to say that Donald Trump idolizes authoritarians, demagogues, political strongmen and tyrants. The essential question must be this: Who are the specific objects of ideation and worship for Donald Trump, the other American neofascists and their followers? The most prominent example, of course, is Vladimir Putin. The American people and the world should not be swayed and bamboozled by the Republican Party and its propagandists, who are now trying to claim that they are diehard Cold Warriors, forever united against Putin and his aggression. The American people and the world should also not be seduced by superficial public opinion polls that purport to show that Republican voters are now vigorously anti-Putin and do not support his war against Ukraine. Today's Republican voters and other Trumpists are part of a political cult. They follow, uncritically, whatever directives and various signals are sent to them by Donald Trump, Fox News, the white right-wing evangelical churches and the larger right-wing echo chamber. Public opinion polls taken before the invasion of Ukraine show that Republicans view Vladimir Putin as a better leader than Joe Biden. That is no coincidence. It is publicly known that Putin and Russia's intelligence agencies have been engaged in a long-term influence campaign designed to manipulate (and manage) the Republican Party, its leaders, the right-wing news media and their public. Putin is an authoritarian and a demagogue. He is anti-human, anti-freedom and anti-democracy. He stands against the future and human progress and pluralism. To many of his admirers in America and the West, he is a leader of ""White Christianity."" Putin has persecuted and imperiled the LGBTQ community, and is hostile to women's rights and women's equality. He kills and imprisons journalists, and is doing his best to silence free speech. Most recently, Putin has indicated that criticism of his regime and the war in Ukraine will be viewed a type of thoughtcrime. He is using similar language to the Republican fascists and the larger white right in claiming victimhood and suggesting he has been ""canceled"" by elites. Putin's Russia is a plutocracy and a kleptocracy controlled by an oligarchic elite of white men. He uses secret police and other enforcers to terrorize any person or group he deems to be the enemy. Republicans in the U.S., and many of their allies and followers, want to exercise that kind of power in America. In a new essay at the Boston Review, Bethany Moreton elaborates: Why would a group of ultra-nationalist Americans celebrate the invasion of a U.S. ally by someone both the left and right have largely understood to be an enemy of freedom? In fact, though, the U.S. right wing has long cultivated ties with Russia. Some of these are self-evident quid-pro-quo affairs: The ""sweeping and systematic"" campaigns of election interference authorized by Putin in support of a Trump victory in 2016 and 2020; Trump's attempt to leverage Congressionally allocated aid to Ukraine for political dirt on the Biden family; the confessed Russian agent who infiltrated the National Rifle Association and the National Prayer Breakfast in a bid to develop informal channels of influence on the Republican Party. More broadly, however, U.S. conservative evangelicals have developed strong symbolic and institutional ties with the Russian Orthodox Church. In recent years, these have dovetailed with white racist fantasies of Russia as an ethnically pure land of traditional religion and gender roles, symbolized by the bare-chested kleptocrat on horseback, Vladimir Putin…. At the much broader level of institutionalized ambitions to ""dominion,"" the Russian partnership has proved invigorating to the American right's overlapping agendas of white supremacy, masculine authority, and anti-democratic Christian authority. If Putin's cooperation with the Moscow Patriarchate is a model for emulation, American theocrats are telling us what they seek here at home. We would be foolish not to take them at their word. In total, the Republican fascists and the larger ""conservative movement"" have shown themselves to be Putin's puppets. To make matters even worse, Putin now imagines himself as a 21st-century version of Joseph Stalin. To wit. In a speech on Wednesday, Putin denounced ""national traitors"" who are supposedly undermining the war on Ukraine, saying that ""real"" Russians will ""always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors."" This is the man so many of today's Republicans idolize. That should make clear how dangerous to American democracy and society they truly are. The form of politics modeled by Vladimir Putin and his Stalinist dreams cannot be precisely replicated in America. As such, it is being massaged and reshaped by the Republican neofascists and their allies to assimilate more easily into American political culture. But it is no exaggeration to suggest that those forces are engaged in a Stalinist revolutionary struggle against American democracy; their tactics, strategies and goals are that extreme. For many reasons, this moment has brought renewed interest in George Orwell's classic dystopian novel ""1984."" In a letter written in 1944, a few years before the publication of that book, Orwell reflected upon the dangers of totalitarianism he saw in the U.S. and Britain: But one must remember that Britain and the USA haven't been really tried, they haven't known defeat or severe suffering, and there are some bad symptoms to balance the good ones. To begin with there is the general indifference to the decay of democracy. Do you realise, for instance, that no one in England under 26 now has a vote and that so far as one can see the great mass of people of that age don't give a damn for this? Secondly there is the fact that the intellectuals are more totalitarian in outlook than the common people. On the whole the English intelligentsia have opposed Hitler, but only at the price of accepting Stalin. Most of them are perfectly ready for dictatorial methods, secret police, systematic falsification of history etc. so long as they feel that it is on 'our' side. Indeed the statement that we haven't a Fascist movement in England largely means that the young, at this moment, look for their führer elsewhere. One can't be sure that that won't change, nor can one be sure that the common people won't think ten years hence as the intellectuals do now. I hope_they won't, I even trust they won't, but if so it will be at the cost of a struggle. If one simply proclaims that all is for the best and doesn't point to the sinister symptoms, one is merely helping to bring totalitarianism nearer. Orwell's ""1984"" was meant as a direct rebuttal to both Stalinism and Nazism. The American people have been repeatedly warned about the dangers represented by the Republican fascists and the Trump movement. The past is prologue — but it does not have to be. The American people can choose to learn the lessons of the past about how democracies succumb to fascism and authoritarianism and act accordingly, or they can continue to insist, against all available evidence, that such evils only bloom elsewhere and cannot possibly happen here. But democracy must be an active choice. Indifference and passivity are sure to destroy it. What choice will the American people make?"

Congress saw a brief spike in approval ratings of 31 percent in 2020, following the passing of emergency relief bills for the COVID-19 pandemic but those ratings have rescinded back to levels from last fall, according to the polling agency. Democratic respondents’ approval of Congress has seen a notable decline. Between December 2020 and February 2021, Congress saw up to 61 percent approval rating from Democrats after they took control of the White House, Senate and House, but in the poll out Friday, the approval rating of Congress among Democrats was just 35 percent after having previously sunk to a low of 26 percent. Gallup notes that Democratic respondents are likely frustrated by legislative delays in social, infrastructure and voting rights bills despite the party holding majorities in both chambers of Congress, notes Gallup. Congressional approval is even lower among independent voters and Republicans, as independents give Congress an 18 percent approval rating and Republicans only an 8 percent approval, reports Gallup. The Gallup poll was conducted from March 1 to March 18, shortly before the Senate Judiciary Committee began its confirmation hearings for President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson. The Gallup polls were conducted over the phone with a sample of 1,017 adults ages 18 and up, across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Gallup’s margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage points at a 95 percent confidence interval."

A pause on student-loan payments, with waived interest, has been in place since March 2020, and Biden extended the pause for a third time through May 2022. Biden administration officials said last month that they were considering a continuation of the freeze as the White House mull over a final plan. However, even with an additional extension of loan payments, many of the younger voters who buoyed Biden's successful presidential bid and helped deliver the Senate majority to Democrats after the 2020 election are looking for answers, and party leaders are growing uneasy about the uncertainty of the administration's plans. According to a Politico report, advocates with ties to the White House are becoming restive, emphasizing that it is becoming progressively difficult to motivate the millions of younger voters who enthusiastically turned out for Democrats in 2018 and 2020 to do the same for the 2022 midterms. Democratic politicians are also asking the president to give the millions of borrowers who have had their loans paused several weeks of notice before finalizing a decision about a potential extension. They argue that major financial changes could create further financial instability for some borrowers, per the report. For many advocates and Democratic politicians, the maneuvering signals a desire for Biden to utilize his executive powers to wipe out at least $10,000 in student-loan debt per borrower, which many millennial and Gen Z voters have been waiting for since the president moved into the White House in January 2021. And those same figures want the action to be taken well before voters submit their ballots this fall. High-profile politicians including Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, have all called for Biden to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower. Ocasio-Cortez, one of the highest-profile millennial politicians in the US, has pressed the White House about their position for over a year, and she has been relentless in using social media platforms to advocate for cancellation. ""The case against student loan forgiveness is looking shakier by the day,"" she wrote in February 2021, just weeks after Biden took office. ""We've got the Senate Majority Leader [Schumer] on board to forgive $50k. Biden's holding back, but many of the arguments against it just don't hold water on close inspection."" During Biden's first State of the Union speech earlier this month, Ocasio-Cortez pointed out the lack of urgency on the issue during a speech that was dominated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the continuing fight against inflation. The congresswoman praised Biden for his strong support of the Ukrainian people but reiterated that he didn't touch on core issues that younger voters were looking to hear during the speech. ""There are some things that were left unsaid that we are really going to have to work on as a party, in order to really speak to constituencies that have historically supported the president, whose turnout we need, whose support we need right now and in the coming years, that perhaps haven't heard their issues spoken to in the way that they wanted to hear it,"" she said on MSNBC after Biden's address. She added: ""Things like student loan debt, the larger themes and crises in education, as well as the piece on immigration was really just glossed over."" Student loan borrowers and the Too Much Talent Band thank President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for extending the student loan pause and now demand that they cancel student debt at a gathering outside the White House on January 13, 2022. Paul Morigi/Getty Images for We, The 45 Million 'They are not doing many things that young people can actually feel' In addition to student loans, advocates with ties to the White House worry that stalled bills that would have expanded voting rights and addressed climate change will only serve as reminders of the administration's struggles to implement core elements of its legislative agenda. Max Lubin, the co-founder and chief executive of Rise, Inc., a nonprofit organization that advocates for eliminating college tuition, told Politico that the president's State of the Union address didn't leave a lot of room policy-wise for the party's most reliable supporters. ""The White House doesn't seem to get that their base isn't just old white people who want to hear 'Fund the police,'"" he told the outlet. ""It's young and racially diverse and we need student debt cancellation and climate action for young people to have a fair shot."" In 2020, where young voters turned out in historic numbers, the voters under 30 who cast ballots overwhelmingly supported Biden over then-President Donald Trump by a 60% to 36% margin, according to Edison Research. However, in recent months, several major surveys have shown Biden struggling with voters in that age demographic — which, if left unaddressed, could spell trouble in closely-divided Senate and gubernatorial races in swing states like Arizona and Georgia. In a meeting with White House officials last week, several activists told Politico that they remained unsure of the president's path forward as it pertains to student loans. A long-promised memo that White House chief of staff Ron Klain said would detail Biden's plans for student loan debt has not yet surfaced. Lubin told Politico that he informed the administration that ""they are not doing many things that young people can actually feel."" He added: ""And if you can't describe to me how young people feel the impact of your executive action on equity, then I don't really know why they would expect them to support or even understand what that policy is."" Democratic Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia told Politico that ""there are a lot of people that are still waiting"" for Biden to grant an executive order that forgives student loan debt. She continued: ""We did what people told us to do: Go to college, get a good job, start a career and a family, but it's holding us back. This is holding back generations of people."""
/r/politics/comments/td5muq/the_gop_is_actually_running_on_raising_taxes_on/,1647173406,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/03/11/gop-actually-running-raising-taxes-poor-and-destroying-medicare-and-social-security,41875,The GOP Is Actually Running on Raising Taxes on the Poor and Destroying Medicare and Social Security,"They're at it again: Republicans want to raise taxes on poor and working-class Americans, end Social Security and Medicare, jack up pollution and corporate profits, all while continuing to pamper their billionaire donor base. About 47 percent of Americans in 2012 made so little money that, after applying the standard deduction, they paid no income tax. This time it's the guy in charge of getting Republican senators elected and re-elected, Florida's Senator Rick Scott. You may remember him as the guy who ran the company convicted of the largest Medicare fraud in the history of America, who then took his money and ran for Governor of Florida, where he prevented the state from expanding Medicaid for low-income Floridians for all the years he ran the state. Now he's the second-richest guy in the senate and, IMHO, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination for president in 2024. And, true to form, he's echoing the sentiments of the richest guy in the Senate, Mitt Romney, the last guy before Trump to have that nomination. ""There are 47 percent who are with him,"" Romney said of Obama voters back in 2012, ""who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. These are people who pay no income tax."" Low income working people in America generally pay a higher percentage of their income as taxes than do most of our billionaires and multi-multi-millionaires. They pay Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, taxes in the form of fees for everything from a driver's license to road tolls to annual car inspections. As Romney pointed out, though, about 47 percent of Americans in 2012 made so little money that, after applying the standard deduction, they paid no income tax. This doesn't just reveal how few people pay taxes, though. To the contrary, it reveals how many Americans are living in or on the edge of poverty. The simple reality is if you want more people to pay income taxes, all you have to do is raise working people's pay. We saw this in a big way between 1950 and 1980, when Keynesian economics reigned and labor unions helped wages--and the taxes they paid--steadily rise for working people. But Republicans don't like the idea of what they call ""wage inflation."" They'd rather just squeeze working people harder, while continuing their subsidies of the lifestyles of the morbidly rich ""donor class."" More than half of Americans make so little money from their employment that they can't deal with an unexpected $1000 expense like a car accident or medical bill. And it's these very people who Rick Scott and the GOP believe need to be further taxed so they'll have what Scott calls ""skin in the game."" In the early years of the Reagan administration, before his neoliberal ""trickle down"" and ""supply side"" policies started to really bite Americans, only 18 percent of Americans were so poor that their income didn't qualify to be taxed. As ""Right to Work for Less"" laws spread across America and Republicans on the Supreme Court made it harder for unions to function, more and more working people fell below the tax threshold. Today it takes two working adults to maintain the same lifestyle that one worker could provide in 1980, so an estimated 61 percent of working Americans this year will make so little pay that their income isn't subject to taxation. Rick Scott and the GOP's solution to this situation isn't to raise the income of working-class people. Quite to the contrary, they're suggesting that low-income people should be hit with their very own income tax--in addition to the dozens of other taxes they're already paying--all so multimillionaires and billionaires like Scott and his friends can hope to see their own taxes go down a tiny bit. Doing his best imitation of Newt Gingrich, Scott has rolled out his 11-point-plan to soak the American middle class, lock down elections, destroy consumer protections, increase pollution and climate change, and squeeze a few more dollars out of every family, no matter how tight their budgets may already be. Scott calls that ""rescuing America."" And it may be true, if you're morbidly rich and made your money spewing pollution or hustling opioids. His plan not only calls for a 50 percent cut in the IRS workforce, presumably to end all audits of rich people like Scott, but also demands all federal legislation to ""sunset"" within five years. That would almost certainly end Social Security and Medicare, programs that have been in the crosshairs of Republicans since Reagan's day. Realizing how ""raising taxes on 60% of American voters"" will play in campaign ads, Mitch McConnell has backed away from Scott's bizarre proposal. But Fox ""News"" is all over it, inviting Scott on repeatedly to hawk his plan and prepare the ground for his candidacy. After all, billionaires like Rupert Murdoch and his family need their tax breaks! As Sean Hannity told Scott during a recent appearance, ""I want to applaud you. I'd like to see the House and the Senate come together on these issues, make these promises to the American people, get elected and then fulfill those promises."" No doubt multi-millionaire Hannity was speaking his own truth. But for the majority of Americans who are so poor they barely have to pay income taxes, Scott's plan is just the latest in a 40-year barrage of assaults and insults coming from the GOP."

Mitt Romney suggests he'd back cutting retirement benefits for younger Americans,"Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah suggested that he'd favor cutting retirement benefits for younger Americans in a bid to stabilize safety net programs. ""If we're ever going to get a handle on our debt, we're gonna have to find a way to either increase revenue, which I don't favor, or find a way to adjust our long-term benefits not for current retirees,"" he said at a Senate Budget Committee hearing on Wednesday, seemingly ruling out any tax hikes. ""But for younger people coming along, we got to be able to find a way to balance these programs or we're gonna find ourselves in a heap of trouble,"" he said. He didn't specify which programs, but a pair of safety-net programs that provide benefits to retirees include Social Security and Medicare. Romney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Many Republicans at one point backed restructuring Social Security and Medicare benefits to reduce the national debt. Those programs make up around 41% of the government's budget and form a perennial target for conservatives seeking to rein in federal spending. But President Donald Trump split the party from that approach and campaigned on preserving Social Security and Medicare instead — a breach of long-standing GOP calls to trim those programs and rein in federal spending. However, the debt swelled by almost $8 trillion under the Trump administration as a result of tax cuts and spending increases. Calls to cut Medicare and Social Security benefits have subsided, but not faded entirely. Last year, the House Republican Study Group released a symbolic budget that called for spending cuts across the board with no tax increases. The Medicare eligibility age would jump from 65 to 69. For Social Security, the retirement age would also rise to 69 by 2030, instead of remaining at 67 starting 2022. Experts project that Social Security won't be able to pay out full benefits starting in 2034, when its trust fund is depleted. The Medicare hospital's trust fund won't be able to cover its financial obligations starting in 2026, years sooner. But there's little political appetite on both sides of the aisle to address it. ""The president is not putting forth a proposal that would cut those benefits,"" Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at the hearing. ""He's not going to do that."""

He added: “Mike thought he was going to be a human conveyor belt, that no matter how fraudulent the votes, you have to send them up to the Old Crow” – using an insulting nickname for Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said Mr Trump was responsible for provoking the deadly Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Trump news - live updates The former president and vice president had a falling out after the 2020 election, which Mr Trump lost but falsely claimed was stolen. As vice president, Mr Pence oversaw the congressional vote to certify the results – a role that legal experts say is purely ceremonial. Mr Trump didn’t see it that way. He insisted – and continues to insist – that Mr Pence should have rejected the votes from states he lost, thereby “overturning” the election. Mr Pence refused, explaining that he had no authority to do so, and the two men have been feuding ever since. “Mike and I had a great relationship except for the very important factor that took place at the end,” Mr Trump told the Examiner. “I haven’t spoken to him in a long time.” Compounding the friction is the fact that as Mr Pence oversaw the certification, Mr Trump angrily denounced the process to a crowd of his supporters, who then stormed the Capitol. Many of the rioters were chanting “Hang Mike Pence!” Mr Pence was whisked to safety, but bitterness over the insurrection remains. In February, the former vice president directly challenged Mr Trump’s claims in a speech to the Federalist Society in Florida. “President Trump is wrong,” Mr Pence told the crowd. “I had no right to overturn the election.” More recently, the two Republicans have been clashing over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr Trump initially called Russia’s aggression “genius,” and praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as “savvy,” “smart,” and “brilliant.” “I mean, he’s taking over a country for two dollars’ worth of sanctions,” the former American president said. “I’d say that’s pretty smart. He’s taking over a country – really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.” Mr Pence, meanwhile, has gone in the other direction. “There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin,” he said earlier this month at a GOP fundraiser in New Orleans. “There is only room for champions of freedom.”"

So how did Vladimir Putin infiltrate the Republican Party?,"On the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, conservative media commentator Tucker Carlson used his nightly Fox News platform to ask why the Democratic establishment was being hostile towards Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told you it’s your patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin,"" Carlson said. ""Anything less than hatred for Putin is treason."" He mused that hating Putin had become ""the central purpose of America’s foreign policy"", which, he argued, could force the United States into a conflict in Eastern Europe — something no one from either side of politics has called for. Mr Carlson insisted his audience ask themselves: ""Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist?"" A day earlier, former US president Donald Trump shared an equally unusual take on a conservative radio show, seeming to praise Putin’s ""peacekeeping"" operation in Ukraine’s separatist-held regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as ""genius"" and ""very savvy"". ""How smart is that?"" Mr Trump asked. ""There were more army tanks than I've ever seen. They're going keep peace all right."" Since the full-scale Russian assault began, the host of America's most-watched cable news show and his long-time ally — the former US president — have scaled back their rhetoric concerning the Russian autocrat. But their first instinct revealed Mr Putin's creeping influence in right-wing American politics, which has gone well beyond what US intelligence agencies called an attempt by the Russian leader to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. It also showed how far some Republicans have drifted from the ""red peril"" paranoia of the Cold War era when another of their presidents, Ronald Reagan, dubbed the Soviet Union an ""evil empire"". And even since 2012, when then-presidential nominee Mitt Romney called Russia America's ""number one geopolitical foe"". Carlson's surprising new audience After Carlson's comments aired on Fox News, American journalist Robert Mackey counted four separate instances of translated clips from Tucker Carlson Tonight appearing in Russian news reports in under a week. In one prime-time address, which was later dubbed in Russian, Carlson declared that Ukraine was ""not a democracy"" and labelled the country ""a client state of the Biden administration"". After researching the interplay between Fox News and the Republican Party for more than a decade, Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at media watchdog Media Matters, said he was not surprised. He recalled right-wing media commentators comparing Mr Putin's strength with the perceived softness of then-president Barack Obama, a Democrat, and sees the cable network's recent coverage as a more extreme version of the same impulse. ""They were contrasting him with the particular type of masculinity that they saw in Putin — with his judo and posing shirtless on a horse — and using him as a foil to make Barack Obama look bad,"" Mr Gertz said. One widely circulated meme compared a photo of Mr Putin looking stern on horseback with one of Mr Obama smiling while riding a bicycle. Fox News made it the ""Pic of the Day"" amid Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""People are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil,"" Sarah Palin, former Republican vice-presidential candidate, told another popular host, Sean Hannity. ""They look at our president as one who wears mum jeans and equivocates and bloviates."" Just six years earlier, Ms Palin had taken a much tougher stance on Russia. In 2008, when she was running for vice-president and Mr Putin's troops were invading Georgia, she argued in favour of strong US sanctions against Russia, as well as allowing Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO. As Mr Gertz pointed out, certain conservatives in the Republican Party at that time expressed admiration for Mr Putin’s emboldening of the Russian Orthodox Church and anti-LGBTI sentiment. In recent weeks, like Mr Obama before him, President Biden has similarly been accused of not standing up to Mr Putin soon enough, by Republicans and Fox News pundits alike. One early poll found 62 per cent of Americans believe Mr Putin would not have acted if Mr Trump was still president. Republican Party’s Putin paradox When Donald Trump defeated Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race, aided by a Russian hack-and-leak operation, it became more challenging for Mr Trump's supporters to openly criticise the Kremlin, according to Mr Gertz. ""You might expect the idea of a foreign dictator attempting to alter US presidential elections would be something that would unite the country in some way,"" he said. ""But what you saw was a fairly wide swathe of the Republican Party and the conservative media trying to find a way to make excuses for it because Donald Trump spoke so favourably about Vladimir Putin."" As recently as this week, Mr Trump told Hannity that he ""got along"" with Mr Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I got along with them well,"" he said. ""That doesn’t mean they are good people. It doesn't mean anything other than the fact that I understood them and perhaps they understood me — maybe they understood me even better."" Many Republicans including Congresswoman Liz Cheney, Senators Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham and former vice-president Mike Pence have slammed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And a recent poll found 66 per cent of Republican voters placed the blame for the war entirely on Mr Putin's shoulders. But Mr Gertz said some right-wing media personalities see the war as a political opportunity. ""I think the cynicism is pretty extreme,"" Mr Gertz said, of Carlson and his colleagues. ""They all made a bet that the most important thing they could do with the Russia-Ukraine crisis… is to attack the Biden administration. ""Typically, the way this happens in foreign policy is that the Republican Party and Fox News, which reflects it in a lot of ways, has both an interventionist wing and an isolationist wing. ""The interventionists will attack a Democratic administration for not doing enough… but the isolationists will attack them for doing anything at all."" ""The pincer move"", as Mr Gertz described it, is ""designed to hammer the Democratic administration from both sides"" and can change tack from hour to hour, or even segment to segment. Which side is winning? That isolationist instinct can be traced back to the early 20th century, according to Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University who studies US politics and social movements. After World War I, Senate Republicans voted down a bill to join the League of Nations in order to, as they saw it, protect American sovereignty. In 1940, many joined the America First Committee, which opposed arming to fight the fascist movement, which was gaining momentum in Europe. Even during the early Cold War, many anti-communist Republicans wanted the United States to depend on its nuclear superiority to counter Soviet power, rather than enlarging the military. ""There's a tradition, which in some ways Reagan went against, actually, ironically, by wanting the US to be much more aggressive and really expand the defence budget tremendously, which he did during his presidency,"" Professor Kazin said. ""So, in that sense, Trump is a reversion to a very strong tradition in the Republican Party, which really begins when the US is a victor in World War I — or one of the victors in World War I — and wants to help make the world more democratic."" In recent weeks, the tug-of-war between the more hawkish traditionalists and Trump loyalists inside the Republican party has come to a head. ""It's very dangerous to have one large part of one of the major political parties in America being very dubious about whether it's a good idea to counter… a nuclear power, which is invading another country without any provocation,"" Professor Kazin said. ""On the other hand, I should say that most Republicans are now supporting a tough stance against Russia, because they understand that's popular among most voters."" A more recent poll found a majority of Americans support the sanctions levelled at the Kremlin by the United States and its allies in Europe and elsewhere. This has left some Republican members, such as North Carolina’s Madison Cawthorn, whose labelling of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""a thug"" was roundly condemned, increasingly isolated. Some of those spurned by Mr Trump, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Liz Cheney, who was ousted from her party's leadership for supporting an investigation into the January 6 Capitol riots, have repudiated the former president. Congresswoman Cheney went so far as to declare that: ""Trump's interests don't seem to align with the interests of the United States of America."" As for Tucker Carlson?

Mr Graham appeared upset that a number of prominent liberal groups had supported Ms Jackson over a South Carolina judge, Michelle Childs, who was also considered for the Supreme Court seat Ms Jackson will fill if confirmed by the Senate. He also took issue with legal arguments she made while acting as a defence attorney representing accused enemy combatants detained at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Ms Jackson repeatedly denied any knowledge or involvement with what Mr Graham characterised as attacks on Ms Childs, who President Joe Biden has nominated to fill the District of Columbia Circuit Court seat Ms Jackson will vacate upon joining the high court. She also repeatedly pointed out that the arguments she made were part of her duty as a defence attorney and did not necessarily agree with them personally. But Mr Graham didn’t seem to be moved by her denials, and instead promised more questions about her judicial philosophy on subsequent days of the four-day hearing before ranting at her about groups she has nothing to do with. “Here's what I would say: Every group that wants to pack the court, that believes this court is a bunch of right wing nuts who are going to destroy America, that consider the Constitution trash, all wanted you pick,” he said. “And … all I can say is the fact that so many of these left wing radical groups that would destroy the law as we know it declared war on Michelle Childs and supported you is problematic for me”. He then dramatically left his seat in full view of the cameras. Mr Graham’s opponent in the 2020 election, Democratic National Committee chair Jamie Harrison, tweeted that the South Carolina senator — who spent years serving in the Air Force as both a prosecutor a defence attorney — “knows damn well that a lawyer’s brief on behalf of an attorney is the client’s position & not the personal position of the attorney”. Attorney and Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin also weighed in on Graham’s lines of questioning, calling them “simply bizarre”. Another attorney, MSNBC host Katie Phang, also criticised Mr Graham’s questioning of Ms Jackson’s public defender work. “Let's be clear, Sen. Graham knew LAST YEAR WHEN HE VOTED TO CONFIRM HER FOR THE US COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT about Judge Jackson's prior work as a federal public defender, her affiliations, her opinions, her positions on issues, etc,” she wrote."

Joe Harding, whose bill was approved by the state’s legislature this month despite widespread criticism, had his home in central Florida ravaged by 110mph winds last weekend. He told Florida Politics that while he was away, his family was at home on Saturday morning when the twister struck. “We are blessed. It could have been a lot worse,” he said. The Republican’s home in Ocala was among dozens destroyed or damaged in the tornado, according to the National Weather Service.The agency earlier determined the tornado as an EF-1 tornado, which is the second-weakest class of twister with wind speeds typically from 80 to 110mph. On Twitter, the tornado damage caused at least one campaigner to argue that Mr Harding was “b**** slapped by God”. “I’m not a believer, but the tornado that just ripped apart the home of the author of Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ law is making me reconsider,” wrote USA Today columnist and LGBT+ activist Michael J Stern. “Hey, Joe Harding (@josephbharding), God thinks you’re a rotten bigot and just b***h-slapped you”. The Republican has been heavily criticised by LGBT+ campaigners for his bill, which effectively bans classroom discussion about LGBT+ and transgender topics below third grade, and forbids lessons about LGBT+ issues. The bill, which has been described as “hateful” by the White House as well as Democrats, almost included an amendment that was withdrawn by Mr Harding that would have forced teachers to out their children. The measure did not pass amid backlash from LGBT+ campaigners and others. Estimates suggest that damage from the Ocala tornado - which tore across 25 miles in 30 minutes - amounts to $12.3m (£9.3m). The Ocala Police Department said multiple buildings were damaged, with the worst seen in southwest Ocala and in nearby Dunnellon, where cars, tress and power lines were damaged. “Today tornadoes hit Ocala hard,” Mr Harding wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “We saw the kindness in each other on full display. Material things can be replaced, human life can’t!”"

""We've been the gold standard of democratic elections. All of that will be rolled back if Trump returns to power after claiming that the only way he could ever lose is if someone steals it from him,"" Hill, who served as the top Russia advisor on the National Security Council under the Trump administration, told New York Times Magazine in a new interview. ""It'll be more than diplomatic shock,"" she added. ""I think it would mean the total loss of America's leadership position in the world arena."" Similarly, Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton told the Times that if Trump had been reelected in 2020 it could have caused ""damage"" to the US ""that might not be reparable,"" adding that the same concerns would apply to the former president winning in 2024. Trump has repeatedly teased a potential 2024 presidential bid. Hill, who served as a key witness in Trump's first impeachment over his Ukraine dealings, compared Trump to authoritarian leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. ""In the course of his presidency, indeed, Trump would come more to resemble Putin in political practice and predilection than he resembled any of his recent American presidential predecessors,"" Hill said. Trump wanted the same ""arrangements"" as Orbán, Hill said, ""where he could push the margins and stay in power without any checks and balances."" Orbán, who recently won reelection to a fourth consecutive four-year term, has repeatedly been criticized by democracy watchdogs and the EU for his anti-democratic tendencies as well as human rights abuses. Critics of the Hungarian leader say he's rigged his country's electoral system to ensure the opposition has little chance of winning. Trump constantly told ""world leaders that he deserved a redo of his first two years,"" Hill said, adding, ""He'd say that his first two years had been taken away from him because of the 'Russia hoax.' And he'd say that he wanted more than two terms."" Hill, who also served as the national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia for the National Intelligence Council under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, also once again excoriated Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. The top Russia expert has contended that Trump's approach to Ukraine helped pave the way for Putin to launch an unprovoked war in late February. Trump, who's sought to rewrite history on his handling of relations with Moscow and Kyiv, used Ukraine as a ""plaything for his own purposes,"" Hill said. ""Trump had privatized foreign policy for his own purposes,"" she said, and had the ""narrow goal"" of remaining in power ""irrespective of what other people wanted."" In a statement to the Times regarding the interview with Hill, Trump said, ""She doesn't know the first thing she's talking about. If she didn't have the accent she would be nothing."" In an infamous phone call on July 25, 2016, Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch an investigation into then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over baseless allegations of corruption. Trump simultaneously withheld $400 million in vital military aid to Ukraine, which was fighting a war against Kremlin-backed rebels at the time. The assistance was eventually released, but only after Trump learned of a whistleblower complaint over the July 25 phone call. After Trump provoked a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, via his lies about the 2020 election, Hill said she ""saw the thread"" between the Zelenskyy phone call and the fatal events of that day. ""I remembered how, in 2020, Putin had changed Russia's Constitution to allow him to stay in power longer. This was Trump pulling a Putin,"" Hill said. Working in the Trump administration was ""extraordinarily difficult,"" Hill said, especially ""for those of us who were serving in the administration with the hopes of pushing back against the Russians, to make sure that their intervention in 2016 didn't happen again."" The difficulties led ""some people"" to lose ""their sense of self"" along the way, she said."

Released Friday by the advocacy group Fight Corporate Monopolies, the poll showed that 82% of registered U.S. voters blame big companies for at least some of the recent inflation spike and want elected officials to ""take on powerful CEOs and rein in corporate greed to lower prices."" ""Rising prices is the top economic issue for most voters, and they want elected officials to challenge corporate greed to lower prices,"" Helen Brosnan, executive director of Fight Corporate Monopolies, said in a statement. ""Political leaders should directly address rising prices, release plans to combat corporate greed's role in driving prices higher, and put forth arguments that center CEOs and big corporations."" The new survey, based on a sample size of 1,000 respondents, comes as progressives in Congress continue spotlighting corporate price-gouging as a key culprit behind rising prices nationwide even as the White House abandons that narrative, despite data indicating it resonates with voters. With gas prices surging amid Russia's onslaught against Ukraine, Democrats in the House and Senate introduced legislation on Thursday that would impose a ""windfall tax"" on oil companies in an effort to ""curb profiteering."" ""Last year, oil and gas companies made $174 billion in profits,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a co-sponsor of the legislation, wrote in a Twitter post. ""This year they're on track to make more. We cannot allow Big Oil to use Ukraine and 'inflation' as an excuse to rip off Americans."""

Trump is facing multiple high-profile investigations, and some legal experts have urged the Justice Department to indict the former president or appoint a special counsel to investigate him. Kirschner has previously contended that Trump will face accountability for his actions related to January 6, 2021—when hundreds of his supporters violently attacked the U.S. Capitol. In addition to the Capitol assault—which came after Trump urged his supporters to march to the federal legislative building and ""fight like hell""—the former president and his allies are being investigated for their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump pressured then Vice President Mike Pence to reject the Electoral College votes of several key swing states so they could be replaced by alternate slates of electors that supported him, despite the will of voters. ""DECLINING to hold Trump accountable for his crimes in light the overwhelming evidence would be a political calculation. It would also would make a mockery of honest, law-abiding politicians & destroy the legitimacy of the institutions of American government. This is an easy call,"" Kirschner, who now works as a legal analyst for MSNBC and NBC News, wrote in a Saturday tweet. The attorney posted the remarks while sharing a tweet from the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). The nonpartisan watchdog group wrote: ""Frankly, we're getting tired of the whole 'prosecuting Donald Trump for crimes he may have committed is politically motivated' argument some of y'all are making. Holding him accountable isn't political, it's justice."" In a court filing this month, the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 attack against the U.S. Capitol laid out potential crimes committed by the former president. ""Evidence and information available to the Committee establishes a good-faith belief that Mr. Trump and others may have engaged in criminal and/or fraudulent acts,"" lawyers for the House committee wrote in the filing. Meanwhile, Trump also remains under investigation by Georgia's Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. That probe centers around the former president's efforts to pressure Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to ""find"" enough votes to flip the state's election in his favor. Raffensperger declined Trump's demand and has repeatedly pushed back against misinformation about the 2020 election results. Whether Trump will ultimately face any criminal charges remains to be seen. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, gave Trump critics a measure of hope in an interview with NPR last week. Garland said that ""everyone"" who committed crimes related to January 6, 2021 would be held accountable. ""We are not avoiding cases that are political or cases that are controversial or sensitive,"" Garland said. ""What we are avoiding is making decisions on a political basis, on a partisan basis."" Kirschner cheered the attorney general's remarks in a Thursday Twitter post. ""Accordingly, the only rational conclusion that can be drawn from AG Garland's promise is that . . . TRUMP. WILL. BE. CHARGED. Because #JusticeMatters,"" the former Army prosecutor wrote."
/r/politics/comments/tje3oq/mark_meadows_now_under_investigation_for_alleged/,1647875711,https://www.salon.com/2022/03/21/mark-meadows-now-under-investigation-for-alleged-fraud-in-north-carolina/,37566,Mark Meadows now under investigation for alleged voter fraud in North Carolina,"Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is under investigation for alleged voter fraud, according to the North Carolina attorney general's office. Meadows, who helped spread former President Donald Trump's repeatedly debunked voter fraud claims, may have committed voter fraud himself in the 2020 election, The New Yorker reported earlier this month. Trump's former top aide and his wife, Debbie, registered to vote in what has been called a ""dive trailer"" in a remote rural area. Meadows does not appear to have spent a single night there, according to the report. Local news outlet WRAL later reported that Meadows and his wife had voted via absentee ballots in North Carolina in 2020, sparking a state investigation. State Attorney General Josh Stein's office asked the State Bureau of Investigation to ""investigate alongside the State Board of Elections,"" spokesperson Nazneen Ahmed told WRAL on Thursday. ""At the conclusion of their investigation, we'll review their findings.” Macon County District Attorney Ashley Welch requested the probe. ""I am requesting the Attorney General's Office handle both the advisement of law enforcement agencies as to any criminal investigations as well as any potential prosecution of Mark Meadows,"" she said in a letter to the AG's office, according to the report, adding that the state attorney general typically handles ""prosecutions involving alleged misconduct of government officials."" Welch said that she was ""unaware of any allegations of voter fraud surrounding Mark Meadows"" until she was ""contacted by the media."" She noted that Meadows had contributed to her 2014 campaign and appeared in her campaign ads. ""It is in the best interest of justice and the best interest of the people of North Carolina that the Attorney General's office handles the prosecution of this case,"" Welch wrote. Meadows listed the Scally Mountain mobile home address in a voter registration field that asks for the residential address ""where you physically live,"" according to the reports. Mark and Debbie Meadows sold their prior North Carolina home when Meadows joined the Trump administration. Meadows is also registered to vote in Virginia, where the couple owns a condo, according to The New York Times. Meadows, the former chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, represented North Carolina in Congress from 2013 to 2020 and was considered a potential Senate candidate before he ultimately declined to run. The former owner of the mobile home told WRAL that they had rented the property to Meadows' family, but said the former Trump aide ""never spent a night down there"" and that Meadows' wife only stayed for a night or two. Melanie Thibault, the director of Macon County's Board of Elections, told The New Yorker she was ""dumbfounded"" that Meadows listed the address on his voter registration form. ""I looked up this Mcconnell Road, which is in Scaly Mountain, and I found out that it was a dive trailer in the middle of nowhere, which I do not see him or his wife staying in,"" she said. Under state law, a person cannot list a temporary residence as their residential address unless they intend to make the property a ""permanent place of abode."" In election law, the term ""residence"" refers to a person's ""domicile,"" or the place where they actually live most or all the time. The Supreme Court in 1972 ruled that ""residence simply indicates a person's actual place of abode, whether permanent or temporary. Domicile denotes one's permanent, established home as distinguished from a temporary, although actual, place of residence."" State law allows a person to claim an address as their residence if they are living elsewhere temporarily but have the intention of returning. Both the New Yorker and WRAL reported that the trailer property has since sold to a different owner and the Meadowses remain registered at the address. Last year they also bought a $1.6 million home in South Carolina. The state's voter registration form warns that it is a Class I felony to ""fraudulently or falsely"" fill out the form, which could involve a prison sentence of up to one year, according to WRAL. Meadows repeatedly pushed Trump's false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Before the election, Meadows raised concerns over inaccurate addresses on voter rolls. ""I don't want my vote or anyone else's to be disenfranchised. … Do you realize how inaccurate the voter rolls are, with people just moving around?"" he told CNN in August of 2020. ""Anytime you move, you'll change your driver's license, but you don't call up and say, 'Hey, by the way I'm re-registering.'"" After Trump's defeat, Meadows pressed the Justice Department to investigate the former president's conspiracy theories. Meadows was also on the infamous phone call in which Trump pushed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his loss in the state. In December, the House voted to hold Meadows in contempt of Congress after he refused to cooperate with the House probe into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Bobbie Richardson, the chairwoman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, told the Associated Press that Meadows' ""hypocrisy of helping to spread false claims of voter fraud in 2020 in an attempt to overturn the election"" combined with his voter registration information was ""unparalleled."" The Washington Post editorial board skewered Meadows last week, calling him out for exposing the ""hypocrisy of Republicans on voter fraud."" ""For the past year, the Republican Party has gone to great lengths to restrict absentee voting in state legislatures, claiming that mail-in ballots allow nefarious actors to influence the elections,"" the board wrote. ""This was always misdirection; fraudulent behavior is extremely rare, and election audits have repeatedly shown that the few cases that do occur do not affect elections. Will Republicans now denounce one of their own for engaging in such activity?"""
/r/politics/comments/tfxsla/sleep_experts_say_senate_has_it_wrong_standard/,1647477987,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/03/16/daylight-saving-bill-health-effects/,37409,"Sleep experts say Senate has it wrong: Standard time, not daylight saving, should be permanent","Sleep experts widely agree with the Senate that the country should abandon its twice-yearly seasonal time changes. But they disagree on one key point: which time system should be permanent. Unlike the Senate, many sleep experts believe the country should adopt year-round standard time. After the Senate unanimously passed legislation with little discussion Tuesday to make daylight saving time permanent, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine issued a statement cautioning that the move overlooks potential health risks associated with that time system. (The legislation, which would take effect next year, must get through the House and be signed by President Biden to become law.) “We do applaud stopping the switching during the course of the year and settling on a permanent time,” said Jocelyn Cheng, a member of the AASM’s public safety committee. But, she added, “standard time, for so many scientific and circadian rationales and public health safety reasons, should really be what the permanent time is set to.” The AASM made this stance clear in 2020 when it released a position statement recommending that the country institute year-round standard time. Its reasoning, in part, is that standard time is more closely associated with humans’ intrinsic circadian rhythm, and that disrupting that rhythm, as happens with daylight saving time, has been associated with increased risks of obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and depression. Although some experts have called for more research before deciding on a permanent time while others questioned the push for year-round standard time, the AASM statement received backing from more than a dozen other organizations, including the National Safety Council and the National Parent Teacher Association. Tuesday’s Senate action comes amid a growing nationwide push for permanent daylight saving time. Though critics have cast doubt on the purported energy-saving benefits, advocates argue that it promotes public safety, with evidence linking the extra daylight in the evenings to a decrease in crime. “The Senate has finally delivered on something Americans all over the country want: to never have to change their clocks again,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who spoke on the Senate floor after the legislation passed. Murray co-authored the bipartisan bill with Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and others. “No more dark afternoons in the winter,” Murray said. “No more losing an hour of sleep every spring. We want more sunshine during our most productive waking hours.” But many sleep experts say that those in favor of more light in the late afternoons and evenings may not be considering the costs. “We have all enjoyed those summer evenings with seemingly endless dusks,” said David Neubauer, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University. But daylight saving time “does not ‘save’ evening light at all, it simply steals it from the morning when it is necessary to maintain our healthy biological rhythms.” Although the AASM noted that chronic effects of permanent daylight saving time have not been well studied, it highlighted some research that found “the body clock does not adjust to DST even after several months,” which could result in a permanent discrepancy between the environmental clock and the body clock. “The circadian clock, it’s not just something that involves the cells of your brain,” Cheng said. “The circadian clock also regulates rhythms in other areas of the body — like cells of the heart, like cells of the liver — and by altering our natural circadian rhythm in this way, we’re throwing off that biological rhythm, and that’s a longer term effect.” While no time system will be perfect for everyone, making daylight saving time permanent would lead to a greater number of dark mornings than we have now, said Phyllis Zee, chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “With daylight saving time, we are perpetually out of synchronization with our internal clocks and we often achieve less nighttime sleep, both circumstances having negative health impacts,” Neubauer said. “Extra evening light suppresses the melatonin that should be preparing us for falling asleep. The later dawn during daylight saving time deprives our biological clocks of the critical light signal.” Experts say circadian misalignment has been associated with adverse effects on cognition and mood as well as cardiovascular and metabolic function. “It’s really not a good thing to have your internal body clocks out of sync,” Zee said. “Imagine being in jet lag a lot of the time; it can’t be good for you.” The current enthusiasm for permanent daylight saving time is “grossly misguided,” said Neubauer, who predicted a return to “the extremely unpopular 1970s dark winter mornings with commuters going to work and children going to school long before sunrise, inevitably leading to injuries and fatalities.” Zee said her “heart sank” when she saw the news of the legislation passing. “I thought there would be more of a discussion, that it wouldn’t be as unanimous.” Of the three potential time systems for the country to be on — permanent standard, biannual switching and permanent daylight saving time — she said, the last is “probably the worst choice.” The AASM noted in its statement Tuesday that the pros and cons of daylight saving time and standard time were discussed in detail during a hearing held by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on March 9. “Unfortunately, [Tuesday’s] quick action by the Senate allowed for neither a robust discussion nor a debate,” the statement said. “We call on the House to take more time to assess the potential ramifications of establishing permanent daylight saving time before making such an important decision that will affect all Americans.” “Everybody advocates a permanent time, but this difference between one hour back or one hour forward is not so clear in everybody’s mind,” Cheng said. “I would like to see further debate and some due diligence done on these health consequences and public safety measures before anything else goes forward.”"

Corra, who uses ""he"" and ""they"" pronouns, announced that their family would match up to $250,000 in donations to the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ advocacy group, during the organization's annual gala in Los Angeles last month. Roy P. Disney, Corra's stepfather and the grandson of Roy O. Disney, a co-founder of The Walt Disney Company, upped that amount to $500,000 last week. “Equality matters deeply to us,” Disney said in a statement, according to the Los Angeles Times, “especially because our child, Charlee, is transgender and a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.” Disney also said the family was ""heartbroken"" when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education Act, which critics have dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay or Trans"" bill because it prohibits classroom instruction of sexual orientation or gender identity with students in grades K-3 or in a way deemed developmentally or age inappropriate. Corra, a high school biology and environmental science teacher, told the L.A. Times that the HRC gala was sort of a public coming out for them, since they had come out privately as trans four years ago. Corra, who has been widely referred to as Charlee Disney in news reports, said that even though they have a lot of support and privilege, their journey has been difficult. “I had very few openly gay role models,” Corra, 30, said. “And I certainly didn’t have any trans or nonbinary role models. I didn’t see myself reflected in anyone, and that made me feel like there was something wrong with me.” Corra, who told the Times that they don't have much experience with public speaking or advocacy, lamented that they ""don't do very much to help."" “I don’t call senators or take action,"" they said. ""I felt like I could be doing more.” They condemned anti-LGBTQ bills, and noted that LGBTQ kids already deal with higher rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and bullying. “Then to put something like this law on top of that? They can’t learn about their community and their history at school, or play sports or use the bathroom they want to use?” they told the L.A. Times. The Walt Disney Co. came under fire after The Orlando Sentinel reported in February that the company had donated to every sponsor and co-sponsor of the Parental Rights in Education bill. Bob Chapek, Disney's CEO, said in a staff email last month that he and the company’s leadership “unequivocally stand” with LGBTQ employees, but he didn’t condemn the bill, arguing that corporate statements “do very little to change outcomes or minds,” CNN reported. On March 11, after criticism from employees internally, Chapek announced that the company would pause all political donations in Florida and apologized for his first statement in a letter published on Disney’s website. “It is clear that this is not just an issue about a bill in Florida, but instead yet another challenge to basic human rights,” he wrote. “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.” Roy P. Disney said his family wanted to make a donation in part because the Human Rights Campaign refused to accept a $5 million donation announced by Chapek last month. Joni Madison, the group’s interim president, said that HRC wants to see Disney “build on their public commitment and work with LGBTQ+ advocates to ensure that dangerous proposals, like Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay or Trans’ bill, don’t become dangerous laws, and if they do, to work to get them off the books.” Sheri Disney, Charlee's mother, said the matching donation was meant to remind people that LGBTQ children need support. “I have a trans kid, and I love my kid no matter what,” she told the L.A. Times."

Prior to the committee’s vote to advance the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Graham explained why he is now against her nomination despite previously voting to confirm her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. “Now that you’re talking about Supreme Court, you’re making policy not just bound by it,” he said, adding that Jackson is an “activist to the core” who’s been embraced by the most “radical people in the Democratic movement.” He also groused yet again about her supposedly lenient sentencing in child-porn cases, a largely refuted GOP talking point that’s been negatively received by the public. He then concluded with a warning: “If we get back the Senate and we are in charge of this body and there is judicial openings, we will talk to our colleagues on the other side,” he proclaimed. “But if we are in charge, she would not have been before this committee. You would have had somebody more moderate than this.” Back in 2016, President Barack Obama’s moderate Supreme Court choice Merrick Garland was denied a hearing by a GOP-majority Senate, and the opening was carried over to Donald Trump’s presidency."

But with virtually no congressional plan to extend the policy into next year, 30 million are now at risk of losing a guaranteed meal for five days a week. This stunning development – which has sparked the ire of parents, administrators, and teachers alike – spans back to April 2020, when thousands of public schools issued sweeping closures over COVID-19 concerns. In response, then-president Donald Trump allowed the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to waive a slew of restrictions on free and reduced-price meals for school kids. At the time, it was a vital executive action that granted students reliable access to food through school programs like grab-and-go meals and classroom lunches. Last year President Joe Biden extended the USDA's waivers through the Spring of 2022 as part of a federal plan to buoy the nation's public school system against the lingering effects of the pandemic. But now, Republicans are angling to nix the waivers from Biden's federal budget for 2023, flouting the guidance of child nutrition advocates who argue that schools arent ready for the waivers to be lifted, largely because they remain steeped in a global pandemic that's seen an unprecedented surge in food prices. ""This has not been the recovery year that we thought it would be. School nutrition programs are still struggling families, and kids are still struggling. We're still transitioning back,"" Crystal FitzSimons, Director of School and Out-of-School Time Programs at the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), told Salon in an interview. ""Providing another year of these waivers will be critical to support kids and families, to support education, and to support the school nutrition operations."" Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, FitzSimons said, the National School Lunch Program was often a dizzying mess of bureaucracy. Parents were expected to fill out forms used to determine whether their children qualified for free or reduced-price meals. Lunch staff had to account for every student's daily payments, logging their meal debt, which has been known to eat into school budgets. Not to mention, kids often forgot their lunch money, sometimes forcing them to go hungry or borrow from friends. And yet, all of these problems completely vanished after the USDA announced the rollout of free meals, said Yooli O'Brien, a mother of two boys attending the Grand Rapids Christian Schools system in Grand Rapid, Michigan. Even though O'Brien was able to pay for both her boys' lunches before the COVID crisis, the program, she said, took a massive logistical weight off of her shoulders. ""All of these problems completely vanished after the USDA announced the rollout of free meals"" ""Universal school lunch is still fantastic because there's nothing I need to do. I don't have to sit there and figure out if I've remembered to load in enough money on my kids' lunch accounts,"" O'Brien told Salon in an interview. ""And the schools are the same way, where administratively there's so much less burden. They don't have to walk parents through how to fill out the forms. They don't have to feel like a gatekeeper."" O'Brien noted that many parents share her concerns: ""I just feel like parents are just stretched so thin right now that, even if you don't need [universal school lunches] from a financial standpoint, the fact that [they're] there is just so easy."" Unsurprisingly, that sentiment is hardly anecdotal. According to a Data for Progress poll from last year, roughly three-quarters of all voters support or somewhat support making school lunch and breakfast free for every kid in America. Even the vast majority of Republicans backed free meals, with just 30% opposed. But for reasons that remain hazy, public opinion on free lunches is now being flatly ignored by a broad swath of federal lawmakers, even though the program has passed with flying colors over the last two years. According to the Post, the Biden administration repeatedly advocated for extending free meals into next year. But his efforts were reportedly thwarted as result of fierce pushback from Senate Republicans arguing that universal lunch was always meant to be a temporary measure whose extension might add billions of dollars to the nation's rising deficit. Chief among this Republican cohort, the Post reported, is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a notorious deficit hawk who last year also adamantly opposed Biden's plan to expand the child tax credit. As of this writing, McConnell has not publicly come out against extending universal lunches, so Salon asked the senator's office to elucidate his position. McConnell's press secretary, Doug Andres, suggested that the White House was to blame for the program's impending cancellation. ""You may want to check in with the White House since they never requested an extension of this program in their supplemental request – or even in their most recent budget,"" Andres told Salon over email. ""GOP leadership would 'prefer to let our kids go hungry.'"" But according to the Post, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack aggressively pushed for the program's re-extension during the drawing up of Biden's budget, saying that he ""made a request to speak to Leader McConnell and Leader McCarthy. Senate Agriculture Chair Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has likewise blamed Republicans for the program's disintegration, claiming that the GOP leadership would ""prefer to let our kids go hungry."" According to POLITICO, which spoke to half a dozen aides on both sides of the aisle, there are still ""intense disagreements"" around how and why the pandemic-era universal lunch program will not be renewed. But in the meantime, there doesn't appear to be anything that the USDA can do to avert the expiration of the waivers. ""The long story short is [Vilsack] does not have the power to renew waivers that are currently in place,"" Kate Waters, Press Secretary for the USDA, explained to Salon. ""That power rests solely with the Congress."" Needless to say, the exact scope of the crisis is hard to assess for certain, but there's little doubt among experts that it will prove to be devastating. Right now, USDA's waivers grant free lunch meals to 30 million kids, up 10 million from prior to the pandemic. For schools, these meals have been fully reimbursed by the SNA. But once the waivers are lifted, experts expect those reimbursements to cover just 40% of each lunch. And in a nation where roughly 1 and 7 children are considered food insecure, the impact will be especially acute on families who are already struggling to put food on the table. In Burke County, Georgia, for instance, where roughly 20% residents live in poverty, two-thirds of the district's 4,100 students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (i.e., their families' incomes fall below 185% of the federal poverty line), according to The Washington Monthly. Donna Martin, the county's nutrition director, told the outlet that she worries about half of her students will not be able to eat this summer if waivers are lifted. ""If we don't get these waivers,"" she said, ""it is just going to be a catastrophe."" Dr. Marlene Schwartz, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity, affirmed Martin's concerns in an interview with Salon, saying that the discontinuation of universal lunches is going to ""make the job of the food service director much, much harder."" ""They're dealing with supply chain issues. They're dealing with labor shortages,"" Schwartz explained. ""Food service directors are exhausted. It's been an incredibly arduous year for them. So I think [no waivers would be] adding a huge amount of stress to their jobs."" In addition, Schwartz said, lifting the waivers will have an especially negative impact on families who are just on the cusp of qualifying for reduced meals. ""I think that the families that were right on the edge, are the ones that are going to suffer the most, because now they are going to have to go back to paying for the meals,"" she added. On June 30, universal lunches are set to officially expire. But in the meantime, the impending deadline hasn't stopped some states from bracing for the impact. Last year, both California and Maine mandated that free lunches be served to every school within state borders. And Colorado is currently weighing a bill that would do just the same. ""A lot of times, if you think back to getting vending machines out of schools, getting soda out of schools, and getting snacks and other junk out of schools, it happens at the state level first, and then eventually, the federal government catches up,"" Schwartz said. ""This may work out that as states start to do it, it'll provide more pressure for the federal government to reinstate the waivers but not as a waiver but to actually change the policy."""

The group has been widely described as a cult. The Rod of Iron Ministries posted a clip to its Instagram page showing Sean Moon wiping tear gas from his eyes while blaming the violence on Antifa. The clip had particular resonance for Dr Hassan: he was among a group of 350 Moonies who, on the orders of Sun Myung Moon, prayed and fasted for 72 hours on the steps of the US Capitol to protest Richard Nixon’s Watergate impeachment in 1974. “I thought ‘if I wasn’t de-programmed I could have been there, I could have been arrested for this’,” Dr Hassan told The Independent. “That’s how far gone I was.” Dr Hassan left the Moonies in 1976 aged 22, became a whistleblower in congressional hearings, and has since helped deprogamme thousands of other former cult members while becoming an expert and author in the influence tactics used by authoritarian leaders. While hosting an event for former cult members in Kansas City in 1986, he met a 29-year-old Ginni Thomas, then known by her maiden name Ginni Lamp, who spoke about wanting to “expose Lifespring”, a controversial group that practiced “intensive self examination”, and disbanded in the 1990s. It was eight years on from the infamous Jonestown massacre, where more than 900 followers of preacher Jim Jones were murdered or died by suicide under his instructions at a remote settlement in Guyana. Ms Thomas and others were pushing Congress to create an annual Cult Awareness Week to shine a spotlight on these groups’ destructive practices. Dr Hassan posted footage of the meeting to Twitter last week, where it has since racked up more than 1.6 million views. In the footage, Ms Thomas discusses the need for cult survivors to “reconnect” with their spiritual needs. “When you come away from a cult, you have to find a balance in your life as far as getting involved with fighting the cult or exposing it,” Ms Thomas says. “And I think I’m really trying and struggling with the balance between that. I want to expose Lifespring, I want to keep other people from going through that experience,” she added. “But I also don’t want to go overboard in that regard so that I can reconnect with my own needs in a spiritual way, which I still haven’t done.” In an interview with The Washington Post in 1987, Ms Thomas spoke about taking part in a “stripper” exercise, which involved Lifespring members getting undressed while taking turns to make fun of anyone who was overweight. Former members say Lifespring, which trained as many as 400,000 people in the US, employed “deceptive and indirect techniques of persuasion and control”. Ms Thomas has previously spoken about how Lifespring leaders separated her from her family and friends, and being forced into hiding as she sought to leave the group in the mid-1980s. Last month, Ms Thomas was revealed to have tried to pressure former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to overturn the 2020 presidential elections in favour of Donald Trump. She also attended the Stop the Steal rally on 6 January, but in an interview said she left early as she was cold. The Independent has attempted to contact Ms Thomas for comment. Ms Thomas had long been known as a prominent conservative activist, but the text messages appeared to reveal her as believing the effort to overturn the election was a battle of good versus evil, regardless of who had won the most votes. “Ginni used to be anti-cult and pro-freedom, and the fact she was sending those messages seemed very culty,” Dr Hassan told “I think someone is unduly influencing Ginni Thomas to believe those things.” After the 1986 meeting, Ms Thomas continued to be active in cult awareness networks for years, and Dr Hassan met her again at another survivors meeting in 1992. Dr Hassan says that once a person has been indoctrinated into an authoritarian group, they are much more susceptible to falling prey to one again. “When somebody leaves a cult because they realise that group is bad, but haven’t understood the psychological processes they were subjected to, and been able to digest them and undo them, then it’s difficult for them to truly change.” Dr Hassan’s 2019 book The Cult of Trump found strong parallels between the former president’s tactics and notorious leaders like Jim Jones, David Koresh and L Ron Hubbard. The lying, the need for absolute loyalty, the us vs them and framing of the next election as an apocalyptic battle bore all the hallmarks of a destructive cult. What has changed since the era of the Moonies, Lifespring, the Jonestown massacre and Waco is technology: the internet, smartphones, social media, and AI. Or as Dr Hassan puts it, the tools of “psychological warfare”. “And then the pandemic made us all isolate where people were spending even more time online, and our minds can be bent,” he said. “This is the feature of being human, we can learn wrong things and believe that they’re true. “In the mind of someone in a mind control cult they can’t imagine leaving and being happy and fulfilled.” Ms Thomas has spoken of having a staunchly Christian conservative upbringing in Nebraska. Ginni and Clarence Thomas were married in 1987, the year after she was filmed discussing her departure from Lifespring. She supported her husband through his bruising Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1991 when he was credibly accused of sexual harrassment by Anita Hill. Clarence Thomas forged a reputation as a staunchly ideological Supreme Court justice, often staking out positions on abortion, voting rights and healthcare far to the right of his colleagues. At the same time, Ginni Thomas would often lobby and advise conservative groups who were bringing cases before the court through her firm, Liberty Consulting. Justice Thomas was also the sole dissenting vote in the court’s January decision that rejected Mr Trump’s bid to withhold documents from the 6 January panel. They have referred to each other as “best friends”, and that they share every aspect of each other’s lives. Dr Hassan says it’s almost impossible to believe that Justice Thomas doesn’t share her beliefs that the election was stolen. “I think that based on their history, they were always enmeshed,” he said. “There are people who are puppeteers of Trump, and then there are different cults that are his base. It seems to me that Clarence and Ginni are part of this religious Christian-right group.” He thinks there is sufficient evidence for an impeachment hearing for Justice Thomas, a call echoed by legal scholars and Democrats. Dr Hassan said there were many factors that went into someone being at risk of falling prey to cultish leanings, including their upbringing, age, social and information networks. Dr Hassan says laws surrounding cults were woefully out of date, and it was time to put in place a legal framework to combat “uninformed consent”. He wants to see congressional hearings with panels made up of social psychologists, attorneys and Christian ministers to debate the problem. “It would be a way to create a public dialogue internationally to say this technology on how to manipulate minds exists, and we need regulation, we need to hold bad actors accountable. “The pimps, the traffickers who are grooming people and making them slaves, they need to be put in jail.”"

That wide gap runs contrary to reports of multiple calls that Trump took as the Capitol insurrection was unfolding — key conversations between Trump and his allies that have helped shape the scope of the Jan. 6 committee’s probe. Here are the calls Trump made or fielded during that crucial window that we know of so far, according to news reports and/or people involved in the calls: Mike Pence The official records don’t include Trump’s final call with then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, during which the President made one last attempt to pressure Pence to illegally hijack Congress’ election certification process, according to then-Pence adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg, who testified about the conversation to the House Jan. 6 panel. The Washington Post has also reported on the call, and Bob Woodward and Robert Costa surfaced it in their book “Peril.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Trump had an explosive call with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) in the middle of the attack, as confirmed by Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA), who has said McCarthy briefed her on the call. That was the conversation in which Trump, responding to the GOP leader sounding the alarm of the violence unfolding in the Capitol, infamously remarked, “Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,” according to Beutler. Sens. Mike Lee/Tommy Tuberville Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) told the Salt Lake Tribune that he got a call from Trump “moments after” the Capitol Police halted the Senate proceedings as the mob breached the building. The caller ID “indicated that the call was coming from the White House,” Lee said, but he didn’t know it was Trump until he picked up. According to Lee, the then-president had apparently misdialed and meant to reach Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), so Lee handed his phone over to the Alabama senator. In wake of the attack, Tuberville revealed that he told Trump in that call amid the chaos that Pence was being evacuated. Rep. Jim Jordan The official call logs include one 10-minute call between Trump and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) starting at 9:24 a.m. on Jan. 6. However, Jordan himself has admitted he had more than one call with Trump that day, and that at least one took place during the attack. Rep. Matt Gaetz Politico reported that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) participated in one of Jordan’s calls to Trump, during which they urged the President to call off his supporters as they were storming the building. Jordan told Politico that he’d “have to think about it” when asked to confirm if Gaetz was present. Gaetz himself has refused to say if he was part of the call."

The Washington Post and CBS News on Thursday obtained 29 text messages that were exchanged between Ginni Thomas and Meadows, part of more than 2,320 such messages that Meadows provided to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!” Ginni Thomas reportedly said in one message, referring to former President Trump. “You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” “This is a fight of good versus evil,” Meadows wrote to Thomas on Nov. 24, according to the Post. “Evil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs. Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it.” The reports have revived scrutiny over a January court ruling in which the Supreme Court blocked Trump’s bid to keep his administration’s records from the House Jan. 6 committee. Thomas was the only justice to side with the former president."
/r/politics/comments/twsiiu/trump_aide_seeking_nh_house_seat_voted_in_2/,1649157205,https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-chris-christie-new-jersey-new-hampshire-congress-734e2b2722c66883eab85bfca96fbc8c,34158,Trump aide seeking NH House seat voted in 2 states in 2016,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A former Trump administration official now running for Congress in New Hampshire voted twice during the 2016 primary election season, potentially violating federal voting law and leaving him at odds with the Republican Party’s intense focus on “election integrity.” Matt Mowers, a leading Republican primary candidate looking to unseat Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, cast an absentee ballot in New Hampshire’s 2016 presidential primary, voting records show. At the time, Mowers served as the director of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s presidential campaign in the pivotal early voting state. Four months later, after Christie’s bid fizzled, Mowers cast another ballot in New Jersey’s Republican presidential primary, using his parents’ address to re-register in his home state, documents The Associated Press obtained through a public records request show. Legal experts say Mowers’ actions could violate a federal law that prohibits “voting more than once” in “any general, special, or primary election.” That includes casting a ballot in separate jurisdictions “for an election to the same candidacy or office.” It also puts Mowers, who was a senior adviser in Donald Trump’s administration and later held a State Department post, in an awkward spot at a time when much of his party has embraced the former president’s lies about a stolen 2020 election and has pushed for restrictive new election laws. The issue could have particular resonance in New Hampshire, where Republicans have long advocated for tighter voting rules to prevent short-term residents, namely college students, from participating in its first-in-the-nation presidential primary. “What he has done is cast a vote in two different states for the election of a president, which on the face of it looks like he’s violated federal law,” said David Schultz, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who specializes in election law. ”You get one bite at the voting apple.” Mowers’ campaign declined to make him available for an interview. In a statement, Mowers said he voted “in accordance with the law.” “I was proud to work for President Trump as the GOP establishment was working to undermine his nomination and accepted a job with his campaign in 2016, registered to vote and cast my vote in accordance with the law, and served as an elected Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention,” Mowers said. There is little chance Mowers could face prosecution. The statute of limitations has lapsed, and there is no record of anyone being prosecuted under this specific section of federal election law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks the issue. Mowers is just the latest former Trump administration official to draw scrutiny for potentially violating voting laws. Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman who served as Trump’s chief of staff, was registered in two states and listed a mobile home he did not own — and may never have visited — as his legal residence weeks before casting a ballot in the 2020 election. North Carolina state officials are investigating. Not everyone agrees Mowers’ situation is a clear-cut case of voter fraud. For starters, it’s an undeveloped area of law. Any court would have to contend with complicated issues such as whether a primary could be viewed as a public election or as an event held by a private organization that is administered with government help. “With the right set of facts, it could be construed as a violation, but it’s just not at all obvious to me that it is,” said Steven Huefner, an Ohio State University law school professor who specializes in election law. “It is a pretty murky question.” Charlie Spies, a Republican election lawyer who contacted the AP at the request of Mowers’ campaign, called the matter “silly.” He said the double-voting was “at worst a gray area” of the law and “not the sort of issue anybody would spend time on.” That may not matter in a congressional primary that has drawn a half-dozen Republican candidates, some of whom stepped up their criticism of Mowers on Tuesday. Karoline Leavitt, a former Trump White House assistant press secretary, said Mowers owed voters “an honest answer.” She said he “potentially violated election law and his initial reaction is to hide behind his attorney.” Gail Huff Brown said Republicans “cannot nominate someone who has engaged in voter fraud and expect to be taken seriously on the topic.” She is married to Scott Brown, a former Massachusetts senator who was Trump’s ambassador to New Zealand. State Rep. Tim Baxter, another of the candidates, jabbed at “Jersey Mowers” and said the double-vote was “the exact election fraud problem voters across America are sick of.” Mowers’ campaign website features a section dedicated to “election integrity,” stating that new laws are needed to “provide every American citizen with the certainty that their vote counts.” He also echoes the long-standing Republican criticism about out-of-state voters, endorsing an efforts by the state’s legislature to make sure “only legal residents of New Hampshire are entitled to vote.” This isn’t the first run Mowers, who is in his early 30s, has made for the seat, which is a top Republican target in the 2022 midterm elections. In 2020, he earned Trump’s endorsement and won the Republican nomination before losing to Pappas by 5 percentage points. This time could be different, though. Biden’s flagging approval rating has made Republicans bullish on their prospects. And thanks to a once-in-a-decade redrawing of congressional districts, Republicans who now control the state legislature and governor’s office, are poised to approve more advantageous maps. Mowers promotes his time living in New Hampshire with his wife and young child. But he is not a native to the state, spending much of his life in New Jersey. A graduate of Rutgers, he came up through New Jersey politics, working for Christie’s gubernatorial administration, as well as Christie’s reelection campaign. That led to an appearance in the 2016 “Bridgegate” trial, where Mowers testified about his unsuccessful attempts to prod a Democratic mayor to endorse Christie, which resulted in acts of retribution and ultimately two convictions of close Christie allies. Mowers was not accused of wrongdoing in the case. He moved to New Hampshire in 2013 to take on a role as the executive director of the state Republican Party. He resumed working for Christie in 2015 to lay the groundwork for a presidential campaign. After Christie’s White House run, Mowers moved back to New Jersey, taking a job with the lobbying firm Mercury. He joined the Trump campaign in July 2016, and ultimately relocated to Washington after landing a spot in the administration. ___"

But even as they express solidarity with Joe Biden’s stance on Russia with one hand, Republicans are launching partisan attacks against the president with the other. The party has, critics say, seized on soaring US gas prices to exploit the tragedy in Ukraine for its own political benefit. Since war broke out last month Republicans have honed a message that America achieved “energy independence” under Donald Trump only for it to be squandered by Biden, whose preoccupation with the climate crisis hurt domestic production, drove fuel prices up and strengthened oil-rich rivals such as Russia. The argument was amplified this week when gas prices hit at a record average of $4.17 per gallon and Biden announced a ban on US imports of Russian oil. He warned that while the move would hurt Vladimir Putin, “there will be a cost as well here in the United States”, and anticipated criticism by branding it “Putin’s price hike”. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, attempted to cast the issue as transcending party politics. “For many in our caucus, and I think on the other side, it’s a moral issue,” he said. “You don’t want to fuel the Russian war effort.” But the era when wars meant unity governments and a shared understanding that “politics stops at the water’s edge” is over. Republicans backed Biden’s ban on Russian oil imports but simultaneously went on an offensive that effectively absolved Putin of blame. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader in the House, told a press conference: “These aren’t Putin prices. They’re President Biden’s prices.” Mike Pence, the former vice-president, told the Fox Business channel: “In the four years of the Trump-Pence administration, we achieved energy independence for the first time in 70 years.” “We were a net exporter of energy. But from very early on, with killing the Keystone pipeline, taking federal lands off the list for exploration, sidelining leases for oil and natural gas – once again, before Ukraine ever happened, we saw rising gasoline prices.” Factcheckers have pointed out that the main cause of increasing gas prices over the past year is disruptions to global supply and demand following the coronavirus pandemic. Only a 10th of the Keystone XL pipeline was complete when Biden cancelled it and it was not likely to become operational until 2023 at the earliest. The Politifact website found that domestic oil production in Biden’s first year was on par with 2020 and higher than in three of the four years that Trump was president. The White House has also pointed out that 9,000 approved drilling permits are not being used. But none of this has prevented Republicans fixating on the issue in ways that Democrats find deeply disingenuous. Kurt Bardella, an adviser to the Democratic National Committee, said: “It just goes to show that there are no lengths to which Republicans won’t stoop to try to score political points, in this case using the unthinkable and tragic situation that the Ukrainian people find themselves in. “To try to exploit that and use it to effectively lie and mislead the American people about conditions here at home is an unconscionable act of political cowardice.” He added that Republicans, in thrall to “big oil”, have spent the past two decades opposing the very measures that would have made America less dependent on foreign oil and fossil fuels in general. Green technology would have shielded the US from the effects of the Ukraine crisis on global markets. Bardella, a former senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee, added: “Republicans were so vocal about how the Biden administration needed to do sanctions on Russian oil and then they start attacking him. You can’t win because everything that they do is basically an illustration of how they operate in bad faith.” “Joe Biden could do every single thing that the Republican party wants and they would still attack him at the end of the day. Republicans just seem to operate in a purely craven political dynamic. It’s irresponsible and downright un-American, and it’s exactly what they would have said if Democrats had done this in the wake of 9/11 or in the run up to the war on terror.” Opinion polls suggest that Biden, like other western leaders, has received a boost from his response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But inflation is likely to keep rising and prove potent in November’s midterm elections. The National Republican Congressional Committee has reportedly released attack ads against 10 House Democrats over gas prices. Ed Rogers, a political consultant and veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush administrations, said: “‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ Biden is going to own whatever the economy is come November. Republicans don’t have to do anything to make that happen. People feel it for themselves, they observe for themselves. “You don’t have to remind people too much of gas prices and overall inflation is a big macro political issue. Doing well as an incumbent is all about peace and prosperity, and prosperity is being eroded by inflation, with gas prices being a focal point.” A messaging battle is under way with the White House seeking to tie Putin to the price rise. But Rogers said: “Republicans have a bumper sticker. Democrats have an essay. Just see how that goes.” Democratic strategists are aware that the issue could weigh heavily on midterm voters. Bob Shrum acknowledged: “The facts don’t matter much here. If gas prices are really high, that becomes a problem for Democrats in the midterms because they’re in office. It’s just a natural tendency to blame someone under those circumstances.” But he added: “It’s preposterous to think this is Biden’s fault. He hasn’t done anything that would account for high gas prices at this point. It’s the Russians’ fault but the Republicans want to ban Russian oil and then blame Biden for the shortfall in supplies and therefore the rise in prices. It’s cynical, obvious and opportunistic.” There are of course legitimate policy debates in wartime and no one suggests that a president is beyond criticism. Some Republican senators, for example, have urged Biden to accept Poland’s offer of MiG-29 fighter jets to be transferred to Ukraine. Tom Cotton said: “If we continue to blink every time Vladimir Putin says ‘boo’ it’s not going to stop in Ukraine.” But Republicans – and the conservative Fox News channel – have made gas prices and energy production their loudest argument. It is a convenient way to deflect attention from their own complicated relationship with Russia, which is not confined to Trump’s longstanding admiration for Putin and recent comments praising him as “smart” and “savvy”. This week Congressman Thomas Massie – one of three House Republicans who voted against a recent resolution supporting Ukraine – amplified a false conspiracy theory about US biological weapons labs operating in Ukraine. His colleague Madison Cawthorn was caught on video calling Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy a “thug” whose government is “pushing woke ideologies”. The hypocrisy is a sign of how the party – and Washington – have changed over the past decade, added Shrum, director of the Center for the Political Future at the University of Southern California Dornsife. “There was unity for a period of time after 9/11,” he said. “But if you go back to even Syria under Barack Obama, they were playing this same kind of game.”"

You are an idiot,” one Twitter user responded. Ms Boebert has filed anti-transgender legislation. Last year, she proposed a motion “to prohibit the use of federal funds for gender transition in minors”. The proposed resolution states that it will be “recognizing and honoring Emma Weyant as the rightful winner of the 2022 NCAA Division I Women’s 500-Yard Freestyle”. The resolution states that her “first-place medal was stolen from her by a man competing in women’s swimming”. Another Twitter user responded to Ms Boebert’s tweet, saying that “kids are going to see gay parents before they get to third grade. You are living in fantasy land if you think your kid won’t encounter a gay person at a young age. Teach them young so they will accept and tolerate those different [than] themselves”. “What none of the replies seem to address here is that Bobo is comparing [people’s] gender identity, their view of themselves and their self worth, to a six-pack of Bud and a pack of Camels. What the f**k is wrong with her?” another said."

The House bill passed by a vote of 220 to 204, with three Republicans in favor and two Democrats against. Republicans said they voted no because the legislation lacked additional funding for local police forces. Some opposed it on the simpler grounds that drugs are bad. “The last thing we need is more addictive behavior-altering drugs in this country,” Rep Bob Good (R-Va.) told HuffPost. “Every major urban area has increased crime and Democrats are legalizing drugs and propping up the marijuana industry,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said on the House floor. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) mocked Republicans for harboring outdated views on marijuana _ “It’s like they saw ‘Reefer Madness’ in middle school and never got over it” _ and for the bizarre allegation by Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) that Republican leaders invited him to orgies and did cocaine in front of him. “I concede our party is not for the kind of cocaine-fueled orgies that a freshman Republican representative bragged about this week – but we do understand that their marijuana prohibition laws don’t work for our people,” Raskin said. Republicans aren’t the only obstacle to marijuana decriminalization, however. Several Senate Democrats have said they’re not ready, and President Joe Biden has not backed reform, either. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. That means that even as the vast majority of states allow the drug’s use, marijuana will remain illegal under federal law, which considers it an addictive substance, with no medicinal value, as dangerous as heroin and even more dangerous than cocaine or fentanyl. Rep, Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), one of the original cosponsors of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, told HuffPost she hoped Friday’s vote would nudge reluctant Democrats in the right direction. “This is the people’s house, people have spoken, so hopefully they listen to the will of the people,” Lee said. The House bill would remove cannabis from the federal list of controlled substances and eliminate criminal penalties for its distribution or possession. The bill would also set up a process for expunging past convictions, create an excise tax on marijuana products and direct various government agencies to track and study the impact of cannabis on the economy and society generally. Democrats argued the legislation would improve racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Black Americans are more than three times more likely than white Americans to be arrested for crimes related to marijuana, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, even though use is roughly equal. Despite bipartisan enthusiasm for the First Step Act, the prison reform bill Congress passed in 2018, there’s not much appetite among Republicans for reforming outdated marijuana laws. Only a dozen Republicans have cosponsored a separate decriminalization bill, by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), that would decriminalize marijuana and regulate it like alcohol. Rep. Cliff Bentz (R-Ore.), who led the Republican side of the floor debate on Friday, told HuffPost that Congress shouldn’t decriminalize marijuana without setting up stricter regulations for its sale and use. He said the Mace bill wasn’t strict enough. “Legalization has, in essence, already happened because [the federal government] has ignored marijuana as a dangerous drug,” Bentz said. “The only way that we can support ‘legalization’ is if we’re doing this in a way that gets control of marijuana as we now have control of alcohol.”"

Kinzinger was responding to Trump's remarks which he made on Real America's Voice show Just the News on Tuesday night. During the interview, Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims that Elena Baturina, the widow of the former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, gave $3.5 million to a company founded by President Joe Biden's son several years ago. ""Why did the mayor of Moscow's wife give the Bidens—both of them—three and half million dollars? That's a lot of money,"" Trump said. ""I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it."" The remarks were seen as another example of Trump seeking help from a foreign advisory to unearth political dirt on his opponents, and attracted further scrutiny given they arrived at a time Russia is accused of committing war crimes during its invasion of Ukraine. Kinzinger, a frequent Trump critic and one of only two Republicans on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack, became the first sitting GOP lawmaker to publicly speak out against the former president for his remarks on Wednesday. ""No former President should ever ask an evil man like Putin for a favor... like Trump did just yesterday. This is absolutely undermining the national security of this country and should be disqualifying for any re-election,"" he tweeted. ""[Kevin McCarthy] must address this, as must every Republican."" Trump, who has not formally announced his intentions to run in 2024, doubled down on his remarks about the alleged payment to Hunter Biden, suggesting that ""in time, Russia may be willing to give that information."" While McCarthy, the House Republican leader, has not publicly addressed Trump's comments, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, one of the former president's top allies in the Senate, did comment on him asking Putin for a favor, but stopped short of fully criticizing him. ""That would not be something that I would do, no,"" Graham said when asked if the comments were appropriate, reported The Hill. Hunter Biden's legal team have previously described the claim, which come from a disputed 2020 Senate GOP report, as false and there is no evidence the president's son engaged in any illicit dealings with Russia. While President Biden has personally not addressed Trump's remarks, they were criticized by The White House on Wednesday. ""What kind of American, let alone an ex-president, thinks that this is the right time to enter into a scheme with Vladimir Putin and brag about his connections to Vladimir Putin? There is only one, and it's Donald Trump,"" White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said."

(WKYT) - A federal judge has ruled that former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis violated the constitutional rights of two same-sex couples when she denied them marriage licenses during the summer of 2015. In an order published Friday afternoon, United States District Judge David L. Bunning of the Eastern District of Kentucky granted summary judgment in a civil lawsuit that the two couples, David Ermold and David Moore, and James Yates and Will Smith, filed against Davis. (Read the full court order below) That settles - without a trial - the question of whether Davis violated their constitutional rights, but no decision has been made yet on whether Davis will be on the hook for the likely hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees accrued over the six-and-a-half years of litigation. Bunning denied Davis’s request for summary judgment on the question of damages, meaning that decision will still go to trial and ultimately be left up to a jury. The plaintiffs are asking for compensatory and punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and attorneys’ fees. “The plaintiffs could not be more happy,” Michael Gartland, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told WKYT’s Garrett Wymer. “As the court notes in the decision, this case has been pending since 2015. They couldn’t be more happy that they’re finally going to get their day in court and they’re confident justice will be served.” In a news release, Liberty Counsel, the organization who represented Davis, noted that the case could go back to the Supreme Court over religious freedom concerns. “Kim Davis is entitled to protection to an accommodation based on her sincere religious belief,” Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said in the release. “This case raises serious First Amendment free exercise of religion claims and has a high potential of reaching the Supreme Court.” (Read Liberty Counsel’s full response here.) A status conference is scheduled to be held by telephone on April 1. A trial date will likely be set then. Davis’s actions during the summer of 2015 turned Morehead into an epicenter of the battle over gay rights following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized a constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry. Davis said she acted “under God’s authority” when she, as the order summarizes, “famously refused to comply with Obergefell, which required her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.” David Ermold and David Moore were denied marriage licenses three times, and James Yates and Will Smith were denied licenses four times, before the two couples were granted marriage licenses by a deputy clerk while Davis spent five days in jail for contempt of court. The two couples sued Davis, saying her actions caused “mental anguish, emotional distress, humiliation and reputation damages.” The case has gone through several setbacks, appeals and delays over the course of the past six-and-a-half years. Davis was previously found to have sovereign immunity in her professional capacity as county clerk, but did not have protection from civil liability in her personal capacity. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal on that issue. Davis had previously asked state lawmakers for an accommodation for her religious beliefs so that she would not have to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but she did not receive one. The state later removed the clerk’s signature from marriage licenses. Davis lost her bid for re-election in 2018."

Bolton pointed to Trump's outspoken criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military and diplomatic alliance established in the wake of World War II. ""I think one of the reasons that Putin did not move during Trump's term in office was he saw the president's hostility of NATO. It was widely reported in American media,"" Bolton said during an interview with SiriusXM's Julie Mason. ""And to Putin's mind, it's a binary proposition: a weaker NATO is a stronger Russia."" Bolton went on, ""Putin saw Trump doing a lot of his work for him, and thought, maybe in a second term, Trump would make good on his desire to get out of NATO, and then it would just ease Putin's path just that much more."" Trump undermined NATO during his time in office. In 2018, he privately discussed withdrawing the United States from the alliance, raising concerns among national security officials. Bolton, in remarks during a virtual event with The Washington Post on Friday, said that he believes Trump would have withdrawn from NATO if he had won a second term. ""I thought he put his foot over it, but at least he didn't withdraw then,"" Bolton said. ""In a second Trump term, I think he may well have withdrawn from NATO. And I think Putin was waiting for that."" Bolton also told Vice last week that he doesn't think the former president would have stopped Putin if the Russian leader had invaded Ukraine while Trump was in office. His comments come as Trump has repeatedly said that Putin would never have invaded Ukraine had he been president and has criticized President Joe Biden over the US response to Russia. Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from 2018 to 2019, when Trump ousted him after the two repeatedly butted heads. Upon leaving the administration, he criticized Trump in his 2020 memoir and detailed several explosive claims about the former president, including that he wanted to ""give personal favors to dictators he liked."""

Since it’s now illegal to address gender identity or sexual orientation issues in schools for students from kindergarten through third grade, the letter recommends referring to all students as “they” and “them” to avoid “gendered pronouns” like “he” and “she.” Also, “Mr.” and “Mrs.” should clearly be dropped for all teachers to conform with the law, the letter argues. The strategy was spelled out in a “template” letter for teachers in Palm Beach County, according to the right-wing Moms for Liberty organization, which obtained a copy of the memo. The group posted the template on its Twitter site, and it’s now tearing through social media. The “Don’t Say Gay” Florida law in fact does not mention the word “gay” anywhere in the text. And since it now bans addressing gender identity and sexual orientation issues in lower grades, the law could convincingly be understood to apply to all genders and sexual orientations. Moms for Liberty called on parents in its tweet to “take a stand” against the perspective in the letter. But many responses on Twitter pointed out that ignoring all gender identities and sexual orientation appears to now be the law. Several LGBTQ advocacy groups and families on Thursday filed a joint federal lawsuit against Florida over the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law, arguing that the legislation is unconstitutional and has already begun harming children and families.

In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that corporations and special interest groups could spend nearly unlimited funds on election campaigns. In the decade since, outside groups spent more than $4.4 billion in federal elections – nearly $1 billion of which was untraceable “dark money” – with some of the biggest contributors coming from Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, and the NRA. “Thanks to one disastrous ruling, wealthy megadonors, corporations, and special interest groups have been able to influence elections when that power should belong with the American people. This has eroded faith in the government’s ability to deliver for the people and their families,” said Schiff. “Dark money should have no place in our democracy. It is time to return power to the people, and overturn Citizens United once and for all.” Specifically, the amendment would make it clear the Constitution does not restrict the ability of Congress or the states to propose reasonable, content-neutral limitations on private campaign contributions and independent expenditures. It would also allow states to enact public campaign financing systems, which can restrict the influence of corporate and private wealth. The amendment is co-sponsored by Representatives Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), David Price (D-N.C.), Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.), Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Grace F. Napolitano (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.), Raúl M.

It is also supported by Common Cause, Public Citizen, End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund, People for the American Way, American Promise, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Our democracy works best when everyone is represented and government works for all the people, not just the wealthy few,” said Karen Hobert Flynn, President of Common Cause. “Several Supreme Court decisions, like Citizens United and McCutcheon, have eroded our campaign finance laws and given wealthy special interests and corporations undue influence over our elections and the policy that comes afterward. Chairman Schiff’s proposed amendment would allow Congress and the states to restore balance and reduce the undue influence of money in the political process.” ""With Big Money swamping our elections and distorting policymaking, the American people are united in their desire for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and related decisions. Americans want and need a country that belongs to and is governed by We the People, not We the Corporations. Thank you Rep. Schiff for again leading the way to safeguard our democracy!"" said Robert Weissman, President of Public Citizen. ""The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision has weakened our democracy and allowed wealthy special interests to silence the voices of everyday people. Congressman Schiff's amendment will unrig this system and end the dominance of big money in politics,"" said Tiffany Muller, President of End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund. ""People For the American Way is committed to defending our democracy. As we continue pushing for essential voting rights reforms, we remain determined to root out big money influences in politics. We must stay focused on the harms inflicted by Citizens United and related cases. To that end, we welcome the reintroduction of Rep. Adam Schiff’s constitutional amendment, and we thank him for his steadfast leadership over the years,” said Marge Baker, Executive Vice President of People For the American Way."
/r/politics/comments/tljbcs/trump_is_guilty_of_numerous_felonies_prosecutor/,1648075526,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/23/nyregion/trump-investigation-felony-resignation-pomerantz.html,30743,"Trump Is Guilty of ‚ÄòNumerous‚Äô Felonies, Prosecutor Who Resigned Says","One of the senior Manhattan prosecutors who investigated Donald J. Trump believed that the former president was “guilty of numerous felony violations” and that it was “a grave failure of justice” not to hold him accountable, according to a copy of his resignation letter. The prosecutor, Mark F. Pomerantz, submitted his resignation last month after the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, abruptly stopped pursuing an indictment of Mr. Trump. Mr. Pomerantz, 70, a prominent former federal prosecutor and white-collar defense lawyer who came out of retirement to work on the Trump investigation, resigned on the same day as Carey R. Dunne, another senior prosecutor leading the inquiry. Mr. Pomerantz’s Feb. 23 letter, obtained by The New York Times, offers a personal account of his decision to resign and for the first time states explicitly his belief that the office could have convicted the former president. Mr. Bragg’s decision was “contrary to the public interest,” he wrote. “The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did,” Mr. Pomerantz wrote. Mr. Pomerantz and Mr. Dunne planned to charge Mr. Trump with falsifying business records, specifically his annual financial statements — a felony in New York State. Mr. Bragg’s decision not to pursue charges then — and the resignations that followed — threw the fate of the long-running investigation into serious doubt. If the prosecutors had secured an indictment of Mr. Trump, it would have been the highest-profile case ever brought by the Manhattan district attorney’s office and would have made Mr. Trump the first American president to face criminal charges. Earlier this month, The Times reported that the investigation unraveled after weeks of escalating disagreement between the veteran prosecutors overseeing the case and the new district attorney. Much of the debate centered on whether the prosecutors could prove that Mr. Trump knowingly falsified the value of his assets on annual financial statements, The Times found, a necessary element to proving the case. While Mr. Dunne and Mr. Pomerantz were confident that the office could demonstrate that the former president had intended to inflate the value of his golf clubs, hotels and office buildings, Mr. Bragg was not. He balked at pursuing an indictment against Mr. Trump, a decision that shut down Mr. Pomerantz’s and Mr. Dunne’s presentation of evidence to a grand jury and prompted their resignations. Mr. Bragg has said that his office continues to conduct the investigation. For that reason, Mr. Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and deputy New York State attorney general who became district attorney in January, is barred from commenting on its specifics. Mr. Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., had decided in his final days in office to move toward an indictment, leaving Mr. Trump just weeks away from likely criminal charges. Mr. Bragg’s decision seems, for now at least, to have removed one of the greatest legal threats Mr. Trump has ever faced. The resignation letter cast a harsh light on that decision from the perspective of Mr. Pomerantz, who wrote that he believed there was enough evidence to prove Mr. Trump’s guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt.” “No case is perfect,” Mr. Pomerantz wrote. “Whatever the risks of bringing the case may be, I am convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risks in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice.” In a statement responding to the letter, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Ronald P. Fischetti, said that charges were not warranted and that Mr. Pomerantz “had the opportunity to present the fruits of his investigation to the D.A. and his senior staff on several occasions and failed.” Mr. Fischetti, who was Mr. Pomerantz’s law partner in the 1980s and early 1990s, added: “We should applaud District Attorney Alvin Bragg for adhering to the rule of law and sticking to the evidence while making an apolitical charging decision based solely on the lack of evidence and nothing else.” In its own statement, Mr. Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, called Mr. Pomerantz “a never-Trumper” and said: “Never before have we seen this level of corruption in our legal system.” Mr. Trump has long denied wrongdoing and leveled personal attacks on the people investigating him, including a thinly veiled reference to Mr. Pomerantz. In one statement, he claimed that lawyers from Mr. Pomerantz’s former law firm had “gone to work in the district attorney’s office in order to viciously make sure that ‘the job gets done.’ ” Mr. Pomerantz, who confirmed his resignation in a brief interview last month, declined to comment on the letter when contacted by The Times this week. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bragg, Danielle Filson, said that the investigation was continuing and added: “A team of experienced prosecutors is working every day to follow the facts and the law. There is nothing more we can or should say at this juncture about an ongoing investigation.” In his letter, Mr. Pomerantz acknowledged that Mr. Bragg “devoted significant time and energy to understanding the evidence” in the inquiry and had made his decision in good faith. But, he wrote, “a decision made in good faith may nevertheless be wrong.” Mr. Pomerantz contrasted Mr. Bragg’s approach with that of Mr. Vance, who made the Trump investigation a centerpiece of his tenure and convened the grand jury last fall. Mr. Pomerantz’s letter said that shortly before leaving office, Mr. Vance had directed the prosecutors to pursue an indictment of Mr. Trump as well as “other defendants as soon as reasonably possible.” The letter did not name the other defendants, but the recent Times article reported that the prosecutors envisioned also charging Mr. Trump’s family business and his longtime chief financial officer, Allen H. Weisselberg, who had already been indicted along with the company last year, accused of a yearslong scheme to evade taxes. Mr. Bragg has told aides that the inquiry could move forward if a new piece of evidence is unearthed, or if a Trump Organization insider decides to turn on Mr. Trump. Some investigators in the office saw either possibility as highly unlikely. “There are always additional facts to be pursued,” Mr. Pomerantz wrote in his letter. “But the investigative team that has been working on this matter for many months does not believe that it makes law enforcement sense to postpone a prosecution in the hope that additional evidence will somehow emerge.” He added that “I and others believe that your decision not to authorize prosecution now will doom any future prospects that Mr. Trump will be prosecuted for the criminal conduct we have been investigating.” As of late December, the team investigating Mr. Trump was mostly united around Mr. Vance’s decision to pursue charges — but that had not always been the case, The Times reported this month. Last year, three career prosecutors in the district attorney’s office opted to leave the team, uncomfortable with the speed at which it was proceeding and with what they believed were gaps in the evidence. Initially, Mr. Pomerantz and Mr. Dunne had envisioned charging Mr. Trump with the crime of “scheme to defraud,” believing that he falsely inflated his assets on the statements of financial condition that had been used to obtain bank loans. But by the end of the year, they had changed course and planned to charge Mr. Trump with falsifying business records — a simpler case that essentially amounted to painting Mr. Trump as a liar rather than a thief. Mr. Pomerantz, who joined the investigation more than a year ago, said in the letter that Mr. Trump’s financial statements were “false” — that he had lied about his assets to “banks, the national media, counterparties, and many others, including the American people.” Mr. Pomerantz is not the only one involved in the investigation to suggest that Mr. Trump or his company broke the law. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, whose office is assisting the criminal investigation and conducting its own civil inquiry, has filed court papers in the civil matter arguing that she has evidence showing that the Trump Organization had engaged in “fraudulent or misleading” practices. Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Bragg and Ms. James, both of whom are Black Democrats, of carrying out a politically motivated “witch hunt” and being “racists.” Ms. James’s inquiry, which can lead to a lawsuit but not criminal charges, continues as she seeks to question Mr. Trump and two of his adult children under oath. The Trumps recently appealed a judge’s order that they submit to Ms. James’s questioning. In another court filing, Ms. James disclosed that Mr. Trump’s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, had cut ties with him and essentially retracted a decade’s worth of his financial statements. Mazars was shaping up to be a crucial witness in the criminal investigation as well. In January, Mr. Pomerantz questioned Mr. Trump’s accountant at Mazars before the grand jury, zeroing in on exaggerations in the financial statements. But the statements also contained disclaimers, including acknowledgments that Mazars had neither audited nor authenticated Mr. Trump’s claims, potentially complicating the case. And some of Mr. Bragg’s supporters have argued that it would have been a difficult case to win. Still, Mr. Pomerantz wrote that he and other prosecutors believed that they had amassed sufficient evidence to establish the former president’s guilt, writing that, “We believe that the prosecution would prevail if charges were brought and the matter were tried to an impartial jury.” Addressing an apparent belief in Mr. Bragg’s office that they might lose at trial, Mr. Pomerantz wrote, “Respect for the rule of law, and the need to reinforce the bedrock proposition that ‘no man is above the law,’ require that this prosecution be brought even if a conviction is not certain.” Mr. Pomerantz is a former head of the criminal division in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, as well as a longtime defense lawyer. He worked on the Trump investigation pro bono. Mr. Dunne at the time was serving as Mr. Vance’s general counsel, a job he had held since early 2017. In that role, he had successfully argued before the Supreme Court, winning access to Mr. Trump’s tax records. Mr. Dunne has declined to comment."

Does that mean the polls are off?,"WASHINGTON — Doctors and demographers recently noticed another tragic example of how polarization shapes America: The pandemic has killed more people in the nation’s Republican enclaves than its Democratic strongholds. They explain the gap by pointing to Republican resistance to vaccines and the GOP’s more cavalier approach to combating the virus in general. Those findings suggest many more Republicans — tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands — have died of covid-19 than Democrats, leading some to wonder with some morbidity what the political impact will be. Will Democrats, facing the normal midterm election headwinds plus high inflation, do surprisingly well in 2022 for the simple, sad fact that there are fewer Republicans? Or, to put it another way: Can we expect this partisan mortality shift to show up in the polling data? A partisan divide In January, the Pew Research Center found that 33 percent of Republicans had not received a vaccine, compared to 10 percent of Democrats. Another Pew survey that month showed a widening mask gap, with Republicans less likely than Democrats (39 percent vs. 79 percent) to say they wore masks inside stores most or all of the time. The disparate approaches have come with a partisan death divide. GOP-run states that lifted lockdowns sooner had higher excess death rates than blue states, an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed. Florida and Georgia had more than 200 deaths per 100,000, while New York had 112 per 100,000, New Jersey 73 per 100,000 and Massachusetts 50 per 100,000. “Between August and December 2021, Florida experienced more than triple the number of excess deaths (29,_252) as New York (8,786), despite both states having similar population counts (21.7 million and 19.3 million, respectively),” Steven H. Woolf wrote. The Pew Research Center similarly found that more Americans died in counties that supported Trump than those that backed Biden. Comparing the 20 percent of Americans each living in counties that Trump or Biden took by the highest margins in 2020, Pew found the reddest places suffered nearly 70,000 more deaths from covid-19 since the pandemic began. And overall, the covid-19 death rate in all counties Trump won was 326 per 100,000, higher than 258 per 100,000 for Biden. The mortality disparity between the parties is large enough to potentially swing an election — the 2016 election was decided by just under 80,000 votes spread among Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. So, could it also be enough to throw off the midterm polls? “It’s a fair question,” said Berwood Yost, director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin and Marshall College, which polls Pennsylvania regularly. Pennsylvania’s rural, red counties have been losing population for a while now — well before the pandemic — Yost said, while its cities have been growing. “Those smaller rural communities lost sizable population,” Yost said. “But, at the same time, they gained voters.” Even though deep blue Philadelphia and its suburbs have been growing, the registration figures there haven’t moved much. “Folks in these other areas are just more active and engaged,” Yost said. “And their partisanship has shifted toward Republicans.” “Despite a population decline of 5.4 percent, voter registration has only declined 2.3 percent in micropolitan areas and has actually increased by 1.5 percent in non core counties, despite a population loss of about 4.5 percent,” Yost wrote recently. “At the same time, the most urban counties, despite a modest population increase of 2.0 percent, [have] seen a decline of 5.0 percent in registered voters.” Recent census data for 2020 suggests that the pandemic might have at least temporarily reversed the longstanding trend of large metro areas growing while smaller towns shrink. Some of the changes are attributable to domestic migration — big city dwellers seeking more space and cheaper rent in smaller cities and suburbs. It’s unclear whether that trend will continue as the pandemic subsides and employers encourage workers to come back to the office. Will the deaths show up in the data? All the pollsters CQ Roll Call spoke with for this report said that covid-19 deaths, even though they’ve fallen disproportionately on Republicans, shouldn’t affect their surveys. “All adults, regardless of voter registration status, are interviewed because we utilize recent Census data of the 18-year-old and over population for weighting purposes. Weighting is a statistical adjustment of the data. Gender, age, education, race, and region are the demographics that are weighted to reflect Census information,” Doug Schwartz, director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in an email. “This process permits not only obtaining full coverage of the target population, but also ensures that subsets within the population are accurately represented within our results.” The Gallup Poll doesn’t adjust their samples for party identification, said Jeff Jones, a senior editor. Instead, they use census data, particularly the annual American Community Survey, to make sure their samples look like America in terms of race, gender, region and educational attainment. Party identification shifts more rapidly than party registration. Voters will quickly align or distance themselves from a party depending on current events. “Last year, you would have been in a lot of trouble if you weighted by party because at the beginning of the year the country was a lot more Democratic. At the end of the year, they’re a lot more Republican,” Jones said, adding that Gallup stopped election polling a few years ago. Last year began with the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, which lowered the GOP’s esteem in voters’ eyes, Jones said, but ended with covid-19 variants spreading and rising inflation, which hurt Democrats. Yost’s Pennsylvania polls pull from state voter registration rolls. Yost adjusts his polls by party registration, which as recently as 2008 favored Democrats by about a million but now is nearly evenly split. “It seems like those Republican areas have been harder hit [by covid-19] and that might have an effect,” Yost said. “But, demographically, people in more urban areas just don’t get out and vote in the same ways.” Registration also tends to lag behind larger shifts in voting patterns. Many union Democrats in rust belt towns started voting Republican right after the local factory closed, but they’ve been far slower to update their party registration. The latest Franklin and Marshall poll surveyed 223 registered Democrats, 200 registered Republicans and 67 independents — a 45 percent, 41 percent, 14 percent split. But when asked for what party they identify with, the respondents split 50 percent Republican, 40 percent Democrat and 6 percent independent, while the rest declined to say. County election boards regularly prune their voter lists of the deceased, so if there are significant changes to the electorate’s composition caused by covid-19, they should show up in the registration data, Yost said. Pennsylvania removed 84,577 deceased voters from the rolls in 2020. The Keystone State also removes inactive voters (after first sending a notice and giving them a chance to stay on the rolls), which helps catch the death certificates that never made it to the county clerks’ offices and unconfirmed moves out of state. In 2020, Pennsylvania removed 157,690 inactive voters. There will still be delays and mistakes — no matter what, the data pollsters use will be at least a little old. But that’s just a limitation of polling, Yost said. “Polls are blunt instruments, not precision instruments,” he said. “They’re useful for understanding context.”"

But the legislative branch also has work to do, and as NBC News reported, the Democratic-led House easily passed one such bill yesterday, suspending normal trade relations with Russia. The bill would revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status in the World Trade Organization and pave the way for President Joe Biden to introduce higher tariffs on Russian goods such as steel, aluminum and plywood. It’s the latest in a series of punitive actions in coordination with the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial nations after Russia invaded Ukraine last month. The House is often divided along partisan lines, but not on this: The bill passed 424 to 8. Naturally, this piqued my curiosity about the members who knew the measure would pass overwhelmingly, but who nevertheless wanted to go on the record opposing the bill, despite Russia’s brutal war against a U.S. ally. These are the eight members — each of whom are Republicans — who voted “no” on the trade-status legislation: The fact that this octet opposed the bill wasn’t exactly surprising. In fact, one of the striking things about this list is how familiar the names are. It was just last week, for example, when the House also voted overwhelmingly to ban oil imports from Russia. In all, 15 House Republicans opposed the measure — including each of the members who voted “no” yesterday. If we look back a week earlier, the House also easily passed a non-binding resolution in support of Ukrainians, which only three Republicans opposed. As for the Venn diagram, how many House GOP members voted against the non-binding resolution, the ban on Russian oil imports, and the suspension of normal trade relations with Russia? Just one: Thomas Massie. The Kentucky Republican is perhaps best known for being derided by Donald Trump as a “third-rate grandstander."
/r/politics/comments/tc7dzk/republicans_will_eventually_pivot_to_the_position/,1647055702,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/tucker-carlson-madison-cawthorn-republicans-ukraine.html,29685,"Republicans Will, Eventually, Pivot to the Position That Zelensky Is a Secret Sex Criminal Who Invented COVID","The initial United States response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been marked by an unusual level of unanimity in public opinion. According to an Economist/YouGov poll, Americans view Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky favorably by a 60–17 margin and believe by a 70–11 margin that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ordering the commission of war crimes. According to the Navigator group, Putin has a “net favorability” rating of negative 79 even among Republicans. How could this happen, given that only two years ago the mainstream Republican position was that the Ukrainian government was corruptly involved in supporting the Biden family (or something) and framing Russia for the theft of Hillary Clinton’s emails? And that until just two weeks ago the right-wing media were praising Putin for defending heterosexuality and free speech? One could speculate: Regular Republicans, particularly older ones, may not have paid close enough attention to the ins and outs of Trump’s misconduct, and the right-wing intellectual rationalizations thereof, to realize that Russia was supposed to be on their side now. Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, for instance, apparently thinks the country’s government is still communist—as did 52 percent of Republicans in an Economist/YouGov poll that concluded March 1. Another 18 percent said it was socialist. (Forty-four percent of Democrats said “communist” and 10 percent said “socialist.” The correct answer, I guess, would be “authoritarian-capitalist with significant input from government-backed organized crime figures”?) The right-wing “echo chamber” is such that many of its figures had actually convinced themselves that the purported Russian threat to Ukraine was being concocted for some arcane, corrupt reason by the Biden administration and the liberal media, leaving them flat-footed and temporarily embarrassed when an invasion actually took place. There are a number of Republicans who still have some influence within the party, like Karl Rove and Lindsey Graham, who came up during the heady days of shipping U.S.-made weapons to anyone who would promise to use them against the Soviets, up to and including the literal Osama bin Laden. They are aware that Russia’s economic system is not communist but are still genuinely excited about the idea of someone trying to kill Russian guys. Ukraine is unmistakably an underdog in this conflict, while Russia is unmistakably the aggressor, and TV news reporting, even on Fox, has highlighted Russia’s attacks on civilians. But there are cracks in this structure. Mega-MAGA Republican North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn told donors over the weekend that “the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.” (I have no idea what he means by the “ideologies” part, nor have I been able to find out—my best guess is that Ukraine is presumed to be “woke” because Putin has criticized gender fluidity and “cancel culture” and the GOP’s newer members assume that everyone else is as motivated by cultural rage as they are, rather than by economic and security interests.) Tucker Carlson, meanwhile, has been airing a theory, previously circulated by a QAnon social media account and the conspiracy site Infowars, that the U.S. has been working with Ukraine to develop biological weapons. Some Republican leaders in Congress, probably for the reasons outlined above, have tried to keep these kinds of theories from gaining ground in their caucus. Will they continue to be successful? Let me answer that question with a series of other questions: Have they been successful in convincing their voters not to elect people who say things on Facebook about how the Rothschild family may have started a wildfire in California using a space laser? Were they successful in convincing their voters to take the COVID vaccine? Did they convince their voters not to believe in QAnon theories about Democratic pedophilia and cannibalism? Did they convince their voters not to believe that “Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China” rigged the election for Joe Biden? No, and in fact that last claim was made at Republican National Committee headquarters. Past results do not always predict future performance, but they often do, and in this case they predict that some sizable number of Republican voters, media figures, and elected officials will decide that they support the bombing of Ukraine because liberals don’t want them to. Once that decision is made, the consensus that Zelensky is the hero and Putin is the monster will sink into the same slurry of conspiracy theories that swallows everything else."

The victory comes as Starbucks locations around the country vote to unionize, and will likely set off a wave of organizing. Christian Smalls, the founder of the Amazon Labor Union and a former Amazon employee, tweeted on Tuesday that the union has heard from workers at over 50 locations since it won its NLRB vote. ""Today I want to continue to express my support and admiration for these workers who are not only organizing for themselves and for their coworkers, but in fact are organizing for all of us,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said in a Monday floor speech. ""Because when you have a strong union movement in this country, you stand the possibility of having a strong middle class."" Sanders congratulated both the Amazon and Starbucks workers, and recognized several other groups who have gone on strike, including King Soopers workers and Kellogg's workers. ""In the year 2022, the United States, and, in fact, the rest of the world, face two very distinct political paths,"" Sanders said. ""On one hand, there is a growing movement toward oligarchy, in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a very significant part of the economy, and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country. That is precisely what we are seeing today."" Sanders said that's one direction the country can continue to move in — but there's also another option. ""That other direction is opposition to oligarchy and corporate greed, and it is the creation of a movement of working people and young people, who are today in ever increasing numbers fighting for justice, economic justice, racial justice, social justice, environmental justice,"" Sanders said. ""And they are fighting for justice in a way that we have not seen in years."" He added: ""It is that growing trade union movement that makes me so very hopeful for the future of this country."" Sanders' remarks and the recent wins come even as union membership remains low. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 14.0 million workers in a union in 2021 — a drop from 14.3 million in 2020. At the same time, around 140,000 workers walked out in 2021, according to research from Cornell University's ILR School. There were 265 work stoppages in 2021, and a third were from nonunionized workers, suggesting that even workers who aren't formally part of a union were walking out for better conditions or higher pay. ""Make no mistake about it,"" Sanders said. ""We will never have a strong middle class in this country with decent wages and decent benefits, where workers can afford to pay the rent, and send their kids to college and take a few weeks off paid vacation — that is not going to happen until we have a strong labor movement in this country."""

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) announced Monday night that they will vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making them the second and third Republicans to confirm their vote for President Joe Biden’s court pick. “After multiple in-depth conversations with Judge Jackson and deliberative review of her record and recent hearings, I will support her historic nomination to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court,” Murkowski said in a statement. The Alaska Republican, who faces reelection this fall, added that her support of Jackson “also rests on my rejection of the corrosive politicization of the review process for Supreme Court nominees, which, on both sides of the aisle, is growing worse and more detached from reality by the year.” Romney soon followed by announcing his support for Jackson on Twitter, calling the judge “a person of honor” even though he said they may differ on ideological grounds. Fellow Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) announced last week that she would vote to confirm Jackson. The news that two additional Republicans will support Jackson is a boon for the White House, which sought to put a bipartisan stamp on her nomination. It also comes as a disappointment for conservatives who launched bad faith attacks against Jackson’s record as a public defender, and who accused her of being far outside of the mainstream. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted earlier Monday to send Jackson’s nomination to the full Senate, moving her one step closer to becoming the first Black woman and first former public defender on the nation’s highest court. A final vote on Jackson’s likely confirmation is expected later this week."

Blumenthal: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas should appear before Jan 6 panel,"Sen. Richard Blumenthal is calling for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to ""voluntarily"" appear before Congress to answer questions about his wife's communications with the White House regarding efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the justice should recuse himself from any cases related to the January 6th investigation, saying his wife's apparent role in trying to reverse the outcome constitutes a ""conflict of interest."" The requests from the two senators come on the heels of news reports first published by the Washington Post and CBS News that Virginia Thomas ""repeatedly pressed White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to pursue unrelenting efforts"" to challenge the presidential contest that Joe Biden won over Donald Trump. The news organizations obtained a series of text messages between Meadows and Thomas, who goes by Ginni, in the days following Biden's victory. At that time, Trump and his lawyers strongly considered their arguments to the high court in an effort to undo the results. Blumenthal, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CBS that Justice Thomas should ""voluntarily appear"" before the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol to discuss what he knew. USA TODAY confirmed Blumenthal's statement with his office. Blumenthal has not formally asked the committee to invite the justice nor does he have any power to compel Thomas' appearance before the House panel which is reviewing the text messages and other communications Meadows had in the weeks following the election. The texts are dated from early November 2020 to mid-January 2021, various outlets reported Thursday. Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the Jan. 6 committee, responded to USA TODAY with a ""no comment"" Friday when asked about Blumenthal's suggestion. But apparently the issue of inviting or even subpoenaing Ginni Thomas has been discussed by at least two unnamed members of the committee, a person familiar with the committee told USA TODAY. ""We're investigating a coordinated attack on on our election in our democracy that has two components: one is a violent insurrection from the outside and the other is a series of aggressive moves to overturn our constitutional processes on the inside and replace them with a set of counterfeit moves and decisions,"" he told USA TODAY ""The attempted inside coup against democracy depended on a set of lies and fraudulent arguments,"" he said. ""And I'm definitely interested in (learning about) any efforts to legitimize those arguments through the courts and the law."" In a statement issued Friday, Wyden said Thomas should remove himself not only from any rulings involving the Jan. 6 attack, but also cases related to the 2024 election should Trump be a candidate. “Judges are obligated to recuse themselves when their participation in a case would create even the appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Wyden said. ""A person with an ounce of commonsense could see that bar is met here."" “Justice Thomas participated in cases related to Donald Trump’s efforts to rig and then overturn the 2020 election, while his wife was pushing to do the same,"" the Oregon Democrat wrote in the statement."" He was the lone dissent in a case that could have denied the January 6th Committee records pertaining to the same plot his wife supported."""

On Tuesday, The Washington Post and CBS News reported that White House records turned over to the House January 6th select committee by the National Archives and Records Administration do not include any calls made or received by Mr Trump between the hours of 11.17am and 6.54pm on the day a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in hopes of stopping certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Trump news - live updates According to the report, the nine-member panel is probing whether Mr Trump or his advisers used such untraceable phones to evade official White House record-keeping systems which would otherwise have documented the president’s inbound and outbound phone calls that day. Mr Trump denied doing so in a statement in which he claimed to have “no idea what a burner phone is,” adding that he had “never even heard the term” to the “best of [his] knowledge”. But the former president’s own lawyer, Anina Habba, used the term three times in a lawsuit against Mr Trump’s niece — author Mary Trump — as well as The New York Times and a trio of Pulitzer-prize winning reporters who, with Ms Trump’s help, uncovered a massive tax fraud scheme allegedly perpetrated by Mr Trump and his siblings. In the complaint filed in a Dutchess County, New York court, Mr Trump, through Ms Habba, said New York Times reporter Suzanne Craig “provided Mary Trump with a ‘burner’ phone in an attempt to conceal their communications”. He further alleged that Ms Craig, a veteran investigative journalist, “chose to use a ‘burner’ phone because she was aware that her and [Ms Trump’s] actions were … unlawful in nature,” and claimed that Ms Trump, the Times reporters and the newspaper itself “knew full well that their actions were wrongful, as evidenced by their insistence on communicating through ‘burner’ phones”. Mr Trump’s third national security adviser, Ambassador John Bolton, also cast doubt on Mr Trump’s denial of knowing the meaning of “burner phone,” telling CBS News that he recalled specific discussions with Mr Trump in which the former president made clear he understood such phones were used to shield call records from scrutiny."

The praise for DuckDuckGo turned to outrage this week, though, after the company said Russian disinformation would be minimized on its site. DuckDuckGo’s chief executive, Gabriel Weinberg, tweeted on Thursday that the search engine would rank websites “associated with disinformation” lower in its search results. “Like so many others I am sickened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the gigantic humanitarian crisis it continues to create,” he wrote. DuckDuckGo has little control over its search results because they are provided by Microsoft’s Bing, which announced that it would follow the European Union’s order to restrict access to the Russian state news agencies RT and Sputnik. But the criticism from the far right was directed at DuckDuckGo. The conservative website Breitbart said DuckDuckGo was “adopting the censorship policies” of Big Tech. In social media channels devoted to conspiracy theories, users vowed to switch to alternatives like the Russian search engine Yandex. The hashtag #DuckDuckGone trended across Twitter in the United States by Friday. And on YouTube, users criticized the company for silencing voices. “If you’re using DuckDuckGo, I suggest you stop using it and switch to something else,” said Tarl Warwick, a self-described libertarian YouTube user with nearly half a million followers. He added: “I want tens of thousands of people to stop using it.” In a statement, Kamyl Bazbaz, the vice president of communications for DuckDuckGo, said that the affected sites were engaged in “active disinformation campaigns,” meaning they were similar to other low-quality websites already penalized by search algorithms. “This isn’t censorship, it’s just search rankings,” he said. The backlash underscored the difficulties some technology companies face in limiting the spread of Russian propaganda at a time when pockets of America express support for the Kremlin and believe Big Tech companies are censoring their views. Last month, The New York Times reported that search results on DuckDuckGo and Bing surfaced more untrustworthy websites than the same searches using conspiracy theory terms entered in Google. DuckDuckGo controls about 3 percent of the search engine market in the United States. The site is especially popular among privacy activists because the company doesn’t track its users, unlike Google and Bing. The company also announced this month that it would pause its relationship with Yandex, the Russian search engine, which was providing certain links for results in Russia and Turkey."

Cornyn criticized the decision, arguing that it hurt religious freedom because many religious people oppose same-sex couples getting married and, therefore, have some kind of right to impose their religious beliefs on others. “Do you see that when the Supreme Court makes a dramatic pronouncement about the invalidity of state marriage laws that it will inevitably set in conflict between those who ascribe to the Supreme Court’s edict and those who have a firmly held religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman?” Cornyn asked. Jackson responded that she can’t comment on the matter because there are currently cases being decided that involve such issues. She was probably referring to cases involving Christian business owners who argue that they shouldn’t be required to sell their goods and services to LGBTQ people because they are religiously opposed to same-sex marriage. Cornyn wouldn’t drop the subject. “I’m not asking you to decide a case!” he snapped back. “I’m just asking, isn’t it apparent that when the Supreme Court decides that something that is not even in the Constitution is a fundamental right and no state can pass any law that conflicts with the Supreme Court’s edict, particularly in an area where people have sincerely held religious beliefs, doesn’t that necessarily create a conflict between what people may believe is a matter of their religious doctrine or faith and what the federal government says is the law of the land?” Jackson then explained to him that it’s not a violation of anyone’s religious freedom to not be able to take other people’s rights away. “Well, senator, that is the nature of a right,” Jackson responded dryly, “that when there is a right, it means that are limitations on regulation, even if people are regulating pursuant to their sincerely held religious beliefs.”"

In the weeks following the 2020 election, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, the justice’s wife, reportedly exchanged dozens of text messages with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that appeared to show her strategizing over how to bypass the will of American voters to install Trump for a second White House term despite his loss to President Biden, an outcome she described as an “obvious fraud” and “the greatest heist of our history.” The latest development, reported Thursday by The Washington Post and CBS, comes a week after Ginni Thomas revealed in an interview that she had participated in the pro-Trump “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. During roughly the same post-election time frame, Clarence Thomas declined to recuse himself from numerous pro-Trump legal challenges that contested the 2020 results. And earlier this year, he cast the lone dissenting vote from a Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for the House committee probing the Jan. 6 insurrection to obtain Trump White House records. “Today’s revelations mean that now, beyond any doubt, Justice Thomas must recuse from any Supreme Court cases or petitions related to the Jan. 6 Committee or efforts to overturn the election,” Gabe Roth, executive director of the left-leaning court-reform advocacy group Fix The Court, said after the Thursday report. “Ginni’s direct participation in this odious anti-democracy work, coupled with the new reporting that seems to indicate she may have spoken to Justice Thomas about it, leads to the conclusion that the justice’s continued participation in cases related to these efforts would only further tarnish the court’s already fading public reputation,” he said. The Supreme Court’s public information office and Ginni Thomas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Critics say the new details, while shocking, are part of a years-long pattern whereby Ginni Thomas’s political activity has posed an ethically troubling overlap with her husband’s judicial position and raised questions about his impartiality. Supreme Court justices — unlike judges on lower federal courts — are not bound by a code of conduct and are permitted to decide for themselves whether recusal is appropriate. In Clarence Thomas’s three decades on the bench, he has never stepped aside from a case due to a real or perceived conflict of interest resulting from his wife’s political activities, according to an analysis by the progressive court reform advocacy group Take Back the Court. But the couple’s latest entanglement, which comes as the Supreme Court has seen its public image battered in recent years, has drawn particularly intense ire, with some calling for Thomas to resign or even be forced off the court. “Clarence Thomas needs to be impeached,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) wrote on Twitter in the hours after news of Ginni Thomas’s text exchanges with Meadows surfaced. That call was echoed by progressive groups like Women’s March. “The revelations that Ginni Thomas advocated for the overthrow of our democracy are disqualifying — not just for her as a human being of any decency, but for her husband Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,” the group’s executive Rachel O’Leary Carmona said in a statement. Among the 29 texts exchanged between Ginni Thomas and Meadows was a message dated Nov. 10 — a week after Election Day — in which, according to the Post, Ginni Thomas wrote: “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!!…You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” The report noted that Ginni Thomas may have been in contact with other Trump White House personnel, citing a Nov. 13 text to Meadows in which she mentions reaching out to “Jared,” which may refer to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a former senior White House adviser. “Just forwarded to yr gmail an email I sent Jared this am,” the text reads, according to the Post. “Sidney Powell & improved coordination now will help the cavalry come and Fraud exposed and America saved.” Sidney Powell was among the most prominent pro-Trump attorneys who filed numerous post-election legal challenges and frequently took to the airwaves to amplify Trump’s lie that the vote was rigged against him. According to the Post’s report, a Nov. 24 text exchange showed Ginni Thomas expressing a sense of reassurance after having “a conversation with my best friend” and receiving Meadows’s vow that the “fight of good versus evil” would continue — an apparent reference to the ongoing effort to overturn Biden’s victory. “This is a fight of good versus evil,” Meadows wrote, according to the Post. “Evil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs. Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it.” The report states that Thomas replied: “Thank you!! Needed that! This plus a conversation with my best friend just now… I will try to keep holding on. America is worth it!” It was not immediately clear to whom Ginni was referring as her “best friend,” though she and Clarence Thomas have publicly used that term to refer to each other. As Ginni Thomas worked to help nullify Biden’s electoral win, Clarence Thomas continued to preside on the Supreme Court, never once recusing himself from post-election litigation that reached justices. An analysis by The Hill determined that, between November 2020 and February 2022, Thomas participated in at least nine such rulings without any indication of him recusing. According to the Post, the Ginni Thomas-Meadows correspondence contains an unexplained gap between Nov. 24, 2020, and Jan. 10, 2021, making it difficult to determine how closely linked Ginni Thomas’s efforts might have been to the three election-related rulings Clarence Thomas participated in during this time. In January of this year, Clarence Thomas raised eyebrows as the only justice who indicated that he would have granted Trump’s request to keep a trove of his administration’s records under wraps. That 8-1 ruling came in a dispute over an effort by the House committee investigating the circumstances of the Jan. 6 attack to obtain Trump-era records from the National Archives. It was not immediately clear whether any communications from Ginni Thomas to Meadows or any other Trump White House officials were at stake in the case. Meadows handed over 2,320 text messages, including the 29 with Thomas, directly to the Jan. 6 House committee in response to their request. An attorney for Meadows, George Terwilliger III, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics say that in light of his wife’s political activities, Clarence Thomas should have recused himself from that case and future matters tied to the Jan. 6 attack. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Friday went further, adding that Thomas should be recused from any cases related to the 2024 election should Trump run again. “In light of new reporting from numerous outlets, Justice Thomas’ conduct on the Supreme Court looks increasingly corrupt,” he said. “Judges are obligated to recuse themselves when their participation in a case would create even the appearance of a conflict of interest. A person with an ounce of commonsense could see that bar is met here.”"

The details, revealed in a Justice Department court filing on Monday, provide new evidence of the encounter between the two groups, whose leaders played a key role in the breach of the Capitol the following day. “While in the parking garage, Tarrio told another individual that he had cleared all of the messages on his phone before he was arrested,” prosecutors wrote, in a filing urging a federal magistrate judge to detain Tarrio pending trial. “Tarrio further stated that no one would be able to get into his phone because there were ‘two steps’ to get into it.” Prosecutors say that after Tarrio left Washington, D.C., that night — part of a court order that he stay away from the city while facing charges related to his conduct during a December 2020 rally — he traveled to Baltimore. “That evening, Tarrio used the phones of associates to make a number of phone calls, and to log back into his encrypted messaging accounts,” prosecutors say. “After having regained access to his accounts, Tarrio assured his men that his phone had not been compromised.” Reuters first reported on the existence of the Tarrio-Rhodes meeting, and the FBI’s interest in it, last month. The new details suggest Tarrio played a more direct role than previously understood in orchestrating the events that occurred on Jan. 6, when top Proud Boys leaders were at the vanguard of a mob that overran police lines and threatened the presidential transfer of power. Prosecutors have charged Tarrio, along with four other Proud Boys leaders, with conspiring to obstruct Congress that day. They also charged a sixth member of the group, Dominic Pezzola, who they say was the first to physically breach the Capitol when he shattered a window with a stolen police riot shield. The case against the Proud Boys is one of two conspiracies charging members of far-right organizations with helping lead the assault on the Capitol. The other, against Rhodes and his Oath Keepers allies, levels charges of seditious conspiracy, the gravest allegations to date. Tarrio will face a magistrate judge on Tuesday morning to determine whether he will remain in custody pending trial."
/r/politics/comments/ttrcn7/irs_audits_the_poor_at_5_times_the_rate_of/,1648821546,https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/irs-audit-eitc-five-times-as-likely-to-get-audited/,26603,"IRS audits the poor at 5 times the rate of everyone else, analysis finds","Tax season is a fraught time for taxpayers, who are understandably eager to get their refunds quickly and who may fret that processing hiccups could delay their checks. But some Americans may have more grounds for concern than others: low-income households with less than $25,000 in annual earnings. This group is five times as likely to be audited by the IRS as everyone else, according to a new analysis of IRS data by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. About 13 tax returns out of 1,000 filed by those earning less than $25,000 were audited in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a rate of 2.6 for every 1,000 returns for people with incomes above $25,000, TRAC found. The reason is a rise in what are known as ""correspondence audits,"" a review of a tax return that's typically handled by the IRS via letters and phone calls, as opposed to the typically more complex face-to-face audits. More than half of the correspondence audits initiated by the IRS last year involved low-income people who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), TRAC found. * Call or write, it's almost impossible to get through to the IRS That could prove concerning given the EITC was expanded through the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill signed into law last year by President Biden. For the first time, the EITC can be claimed by both younger workers and senior citizens, which means more people could find themselves on the other side of an IRS audit after filing their returns in the current tax season, which ends on April 18. There's an explanation for why returns claiming the EITC are more likely to trigger an audit than other tax returns.  One analysis found that as many as half of returns claiming the tax credit had erroneously claimed too much, or even incorrectly claimed the credit at all, according to the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""How fair of a tax system""? But the higher rate of audits among poor taxpayers also raises questions of fairness and whether it represents the best use of resources, said Susan B. Long, co-director of TRAC and a professor of managerial statistics at Syracuse. ""When you have a tax system where you are targeting the lowest-wage earners at a much higher rate than higher-income taxpayers, how fair of a tax system is that?"" Long told CBS MoneyWatch. ""And what does it do to the confidence of taxpayers?"" She added, ""And at the same time when you don't provide the agency with the budget to fairly administer the tax laws — this is really shortsighted."" The IRS didn't immediately comment on the TRAC report, but it pointed to a blog post about audit rates. Taxpayers with incomes of more than $10 million had ""substantially higher audit rates"" than those in every other income category from 2010 to 2015, the agency noted. Your risk of getting audited The risk of getting audited by the IRS has been declining for years due in part to a shrinking workforce. The agency employed about 82,000 workers in fiscal year 2021, compared with about 94,000 workers in 2010. With fewer agents on hand, the audit rate has declined steadily — including for millionaires, TRAC noted. The number of people with incomes over $1 million has jumped by 50% over the last decade, TRAC noted. But the number of audits on million-dollar tax returns dwindled to about 14,000 last year from about 41,000 in 2012, the analysis found. The upshot: Whatever your income level, the odds of getting audited has declined. The audit rate slipped to 0.2% in 2020 due to the pandemic, according to Jackson Hewitt. That compares with an audit rate of about 0.9% in 2009. Still, the focus on auditing low-wage workers raises the question of efficiency as well as fairness, Long said. After all, wealthier taxpayers could prove more lucrative to the IRS in terms of collecting unpaid taxes. That idea was at the center of the Biden administration's Build Back Better plan, which would have been funded partially by bolstering tax enforcement at the IRS. The idea: spend $80 billion for the IRS to hire more specialized agents to root out tax evasion, as well as update the agency's technology. The White House forecast that it could generate an additional $400 billion over 10 years. But with the Build Back Better Act stalling in Congress, it's unclear whether the IRS will receive more funding. ""The IRS has a real problem if you don't have the staff to do a decent job,"" Long said. ""Lowest level of customer service"" Correspondence audits were cited as one of the IRS' biggest problems by National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins in her report to Congress earlier this year. Taxpayers who get caught up in these audits are often the lowest-earning Americans, she noted. At the same time, the IRS devotes the ""least amount of resources to conduct the largest number of examinations,"" she found. That results in ""the lowest level of customer service to taxpayers having the greatest need for assistance,"" Collins wrote. Getting a letter from the IRS can be confusing, even to people familiar with taxes, Long said. Taxpayers who get a correspondence audit frequently can't reach a single point of contact when they call the IRS to get answers or track down the information they sent to agency, Collins wrote. (And last year, simply getting through to the IRS was almost an impossibility.) ""It's unbelievable, the focus and targeting on the poorest families,"" Long said. ""It's five times the rate for everyone else — does this really make sense?"""

Democrats, for the most part, have not responded with the urgency required to save America's democracy from the rising neofascist tide. American society was founded on white settler colonialism, genocide and slavery. This unresolved birth defect at the foundation of the American democratic experiment meant that the country was racially exclusionary by design, from the founding well into the 20th century. At present, American politics is contoured by asymmetrical political polarization, in which Republicans have moved so far to the right that the party's most ""moderate"" members are far more extreme than the most ""conservative"" Democrats. This makes substantive compromise and bipartisanship in the interests of the common good and the American people almost impossible. Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, Trump supporters and Trump-loathers, increasingly do not live in the same neighborhoods or communities. In all, they largely do not socialize with each other, or have other forms of meaningful interpersonal relationships in day-to-day life. To the degree that ""race"" is a proxy for political values and beliefs, the color line functions as a practical dividing line of partisan identity and voting. Religion is also a societal space that is divided by politics. For example, public opinion research shows that white right-wing evangelical Christians have increasingly embraced authoritarian views, conspiracy theories and other anti-democratic and antisocial values. As the new Faith in America survey by Deseret News & Marist College highlights, the basic understanding of the role of religion in a secular democracy has become so polarized that 70% of Republicans believe that religion should influence a person's political values, where as only 28% of Democrats and 45% of independents share that view. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, also do not consume the same sources of information about news and politics. Conservatives now inhabit their own self-created media echo chamber, which functions as a type of lie-filled and toxic closed episteme and sealed-off universe. The creation of such an alternate reality is an important attribute of fascism, in which truth itself must be destroyed and replaced with fantasies and fictions in support of the leader and his movement. America's struggle for democracy and freedom against authoritarianism is taking place on a biological level as well. Social psychologists and other researchers have shown that the brain structures of conservative-authoritarians are different than those of more liberal and progressive thinkers. The former are more fear-centered, emphasizing threats and dangers (negativity bias), intolerant of ambiguity and inclined to simple, binary solutions. Conservative-authoritarians are also strongly attracted to moral hierarchy and social dominance behavior. Recent research by Darren Sherkat, a professor of sociology at Southern Illinois University, demonstrates that America's democracy crisis may be even more intractable than the above evidence suggests. In his recent article ""Cognitive Sophistication, Religion, and the Trump Vote,"" which appeared in the January 2021 edition of Social Science Quarterly, Sherkat examined data from the 2018 General Social Survey and concluded that there are substantial negative differences between the thinking processes and cognition of white Trump voters, as shown in the 2016 presidential election, as compared to other voters who supported Hillary Clinton or another candidate, or who did not vote at all. Sherkat observes that Trump support has been linked to religion and level of education, but until now not to ""cognitive sophistication,"" which was found ""to have a positive effect on voting, but a negative effect on choosing Trump."" He notes that ""philosophers and political elites have debated the potential effects of mass political participation"" for generations, concerned ""about the unsophisticated masses coming under the sway of a demagogue."" In effect, this debate was always about the quality he calls cognitive sophistication, since citizens who lack it ""may not be able to understand and access reliable and valid information about political issues and may be vulnerable to political propaganda"": Low levels of cognitive sophistication may lead people to embrace simple cognitive shortcuts, like stereotypes and prejudices that were amplified by the Trump campaign. Additionally, the simple linguistic style presented by Trump may have appealed to voters with limited education and cognitive sophistication. Beginning with [T.W.] Adorno's classic study of the authoritarian personality, empirical works have linked low levels of cognitive sophistication with right-wing orientations.... Trump's campaign may also have been more attractive to people with low cognitive sophistication and a preference for low-effort information processing because compared to other candidates Trump's speeches were given at a much lower reading level…. While much of the Trump campaign's rhetoric and orientation may have resonated with the poorly educated and cognitively unsophisticated, those overlapping groups are less likely to register to vote or to turn out in an election. As part of his research, Sherkat evaluated the political decision-making and cognition of Trump's voters, using a 10-point vocabulary exam. In a guest essay at the website Down with Tyranny, he explains what this vocabulary test revealed about white Trump voters: Overall, the model predicts that almost 73% of respondents who missed all 10 questions would vote for Trump (remember, that is controlling for education and the other factors), while about 51% who were average on the exam are expected to vote for Trump. Only 35% of people who had a perfect score on the exam are predicted to be Trump supporters. Notably, this very strong, significant effect of verbal ability can be identified within educational groups. While non-college whites certainly turned out more heavily for Trump, the smart ones did not — only 38% of those with perfect scores are expected to go for Trump, and only 46% of non-college graduates who scored a standard deviation above the mean. The same is true for college graduates — low cognition college graduates were more likely to vote for Trump. ... What is really depressing isn't just the poles of the vocabulary exam, it's the average. The mean and median of the scale is 6 — so half of white Americans missed 4 of the easy vocabulary questions. Sherkat's research also explored how religion impacted support for Donald Trump among white voters: ""This study confirms that white Americans with fundamentalist views of the Bible and those who embrace identifications with sectarian Protestant denominations tended to vote for Donald Trump in the 2016 election."" Belief that the Bible is the literal ""word of God"" also impacted Trump voting: ""Viewing the Bible as a book of fables is also significantly predictive of vote choice, with secular beliefs reducing the odds of a Trump vote by 80 percent when compared to literalists, and reducing the odds of a Trump vote by 52 percent when compared to respondents who view the Bible as inspired by God."" In an email to Salon, Sherkat offered additional context and implication on the relationship between white Christianity, American neofascism and cognition: The problem of the contemporary American fascist right is rooted in education and information. And this problem is not simply about attainment of some quantity of education, but of the quality and content of education, how that leads generations of white Christian Americans to process information about a wide range of issues. The segregation academies that proliferated in the mid-1960s and accelerated in the 1970s have taught millions of Americans a radically skewed version of American and world history and encouraged a continued segregated society. The homeschooling movement augmented this division, and further denigrated the value of knowledge. White fundamentalist Christians have always segmented their communities from the rest of America, and even exert considerable control over public educational institutions, particularly in rural areas and in the states which embraced slavery. White fundamentalist Christians distrust mainstream social institutions like education and print media, and they actively seek to eliminate public education and to provide alternative sources of information. As a result, people who identify with and participate in white Christian denominations and who subscribe to fundamentalist beliefs have substantial intellectual deficits that make them easy marks for a wide variety of schemes — from financial fraud to conspiracy theories. If you can't read the New York Times, you're going to believe whatever you hear on talk radio or on television. It's simply impossible for people with limited vocabularies and low levels of cognitive functioning to make sense of the complex realities of the political world. And we now have a population where for 55 years substantial fractions of white people have gone to private fundamentalist Christian schools that leave them both indoctrinated in Christian nationalism and ill-prepared to process any additional information. Worse, we now have over a million children in a given year who are homeschooled by parents who are uneducated white fundamentalists — and that total has been pretty constant for three decades since the homeschooling movement blossomed. What does this mean for the present and future of American democracy in this time of crisis? Sherkat cited the ""disturbing ... influence of anti-intellectualism on American public life,"" which lends ""performative power to ignorant elites"": Spouting off obvious untruths is no longer a mark of shame, because even basic historical and contemporary truths are not recognized. We seem to have a stable set of about 30% of Americans, 35% of white Americans, who are oblivious to political realities and incapable and unwilling to come to terms with any of our key social problems. The increasing control over public education by right-wing fanatics is entrenching ignorance and intellectual laziness in future generations. It does not bode well for the future of American democracy. Donald Trump and his movement did not create all these American authoritarians and aspiring fascists. Such people have long been a feature of American society. What Trump and the Republican-fascists and their movement have accomplished in recent years is to empower and normalize a dangerous set of antisocial, anti-human, retrograde and anti-democratic values and beliefs. Saving America's democracy will require a moral and political reckoning and acts of critical self-reflection on a nationwide scale about the American people's character and values, and about how their leaders and governing institutions have failed them. Changes in laws and institutions are necessary. But on their own, such interventions will not stop the spread of fascism. A lasting remedy will demand that the country's political, cultural, and educational institutions be renewed, re-energized, and reimagined. The questions Americans must ask themselves are simple yet enormous: Who are we? What are we to become? How can we unite in defense of democracy, the common good and the general welfare? Without real answers to those questions, there will be no democratic renewal in the 21st century -- and fascism wins."

Preparing to Investigate How Classified Material Went to Trump‚Äôs Home,"Federal authorities are in the preliminary stages of investigating the handling of classified material found at former President Donald J. Trump’s Florida home after he left office, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The effort, led by the F.B.I., stems from the discovery of classified information in 15 boxes that contained documents, mementos, gifts and letters that had been taken from the White House at the end of Mr. Trump’s term in apparent violation of the requirements for turning over all presidential records to the National Archives. The development was reported earlier by The Washington Post. The National Archives said in February that it had consulted with the Justice Department about the classified material, which it retrieved the previous month from Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. The agency described the materials in question as “classified national security information.” The Justice Department has instructed the National Archives not to share with the House Oversight Committee, which is conducting its own investigation, details about the material taken from the White House by Mr. Trump, the committee disclosed on Thursday, in a hint that a criminal investigation might be underway. In cases of this type, the F.B.I. would typically look at an array of scenarios, including whether the classified material was mishandled or inadvertently disclosed, and it could examine whether a foreign adversary might have gotten access. The investigation could put Mr. Trump at odds with the F.B.I. yet again. In July 2016, the F.B.I. opened a highly sensitive investigation into whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates conspired with the Russians during the presidential campaign. The F.B.I. and prosecutors would later investigate Mr. Trump for obstruction after he fired James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in May 2017. A decision to open such a sensitive investigation would have required approval from senior F.B.I. officials at headquarters. Typically, opening such a high-profile case would include discussions with top Justice Department leaders, including the National Security Division. Before proceeding with an investigation, the F.B.I. almost certainly would want an official determination from any agency involved that information was properly classified. What role Mr. Trump played in taking the material from the White House, if any, is not publicly known. It is not likely that he would be a target of the investigation himself at the moment. In the Hillary Clinton investigation involving the emailing of classified information using a private server, the F.B.I. did not target anyone individually. As part of any investigation, the F.B.I. would want to find out why the classified material was in Mr. Trump’s possession and who had access to it. Then agents would want to determine who packed the boxes and transported them to Florida and the circumstances surrounding that episode. Assessing Mr. Trump’s role could be complex, in part because, as president, Mr. Trump had the ability to easily declassify whatever information he wanted. Mr. Trump made attacking Mrs. Clinton’s mishandling of national security materials a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign. The latest revelations about Mr. Trump’s own laxity with classified information and his haphazard adherence to federal record-keeping laws have spurred Democrats to accuse him of rank hypocrisy. The House Oversight Committee is investigating Mr. Trump’s possible violations of the Presidential Records Act and other federal statutes. The panel has been seeking information about the contents of the boxes and looking into reports that Mr. Trump “had torn up, destroyed, mutilated or attempted to tear up, destroy or mutilate” documents while in office. The committee is also investigating reports of “White House employees or contractors finding paper in a toilet in the White House, including the White House residence.” The Justice Department’s refusal to fully cooperate with House investigators prompted an angry letter on Thursday from Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, who accused Attorney General Merrick B. Garland’s agency of “obstructing” the panel’s work. The National Archives informed the committee on March 28 that it was withholding information about the contents of the boxes found at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate and any information about any reviews conducted by other federal agencies, Ms. Maloney said in her letter. “Based on our consultation with the Department of Justice, we are unable to provide any comment,” the archives told the committee. “By blocking NARA from producing the documents requested by the committee, the department is obstructing the committee’s investigation,” Ms. Maloney wrote on Thursday to Mr. Garland, referring to the National Archives and Records Administration. “The committee does not wish to interfere in any manner with any potential or ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice. However, the committee has not received any explanation as to why the department is preventing NARA from providing information to the committee that relates to compliance” with the Presidential Records Act, “including unclassified information describing the contents of the 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago.” A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Trump’s penchant for tearing up presidential records was revealed in a 2018 Politico article, but in the past few weeks, a series of disclosures has raised new questions about the Trump administration’s failure to follow federal record-keeping laws and its handling of classified information as Mr. Trump left office. A book scheduled to be released in October by a New York Times reporter revealed how staff members in the White House residence periodically discovered wads of printed paper clogging a toilet, leading them to believe that Mr. Trump had tried to flush them. In a recent statement, Mr. Trump said the boxed material had been turned over to the archives as part of “an ordinary and routine process” and suggested that efforts by Democrats to raise questions about his handling of the documents were a scam. “The fake news is making it seem like me, as the president of the United States, was working in a filing room,” he said. The clash with Mr. Garland is the latest example of congressional Democrats’ growing frustration with the Justice Department. Last week, members of the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol urged the attorney general to move more quickly to charge Mr. Trump’s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, with contempt of Congress. One member of the panel, Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia, told him, “Do your job so we can do ours.”"
/r/politics/comments/tfenn9/house_republicans_who_challenged_bidens_win_are/,1647426988,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/house-republicans-who-challenged-bidens-win-are-losing-lots-corporate-cash-2022-03-16/,26045,Insight: House Republicans who challenged Biden's win are losing lots of corporate cash,"WASHINGTON — In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, dozens of companies said they would suspend political donations to Republican lawmakers who had backed then-President Donald Trump's baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. More than one year later, Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted to challenge the election results have so far collected about half as much corporate cash as they did at this point in the previous election cycle, a Reuters analysis of campaign finance records shows. By contrast, corporate donations are up about 10% to House Republicans who voted to certify President Joe Biden's victory over Trump. The results indicate that the corporate boycott is not just limited to the dozens of companies that announced a halt to donations after the attack. Hundreds more have also scaled back their support, the Reuters analysis shows. The shift illustrates the growing gulf between business interests and the right wing of the Republican Party, which under Trump's presidency grew more anti-establishment and more open to curbs on global trade and technology that would have been anathema in previous years. ""You've got members that are increasingly unmoored from commercial corporate interests and are more responsive to either a small number of very wealthy, deep-pocketed donors, or a large number of culture war-activated base voters,"" said Jon Lieber, a former staffer for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell now at the Eurasia Group, an analysis firm. The drop in corporate donations is unlikely to affect Republican prospects in the November congressional elections. The party is favored to win control of the House and possibly the Senate, in part due to Biden's sagging popularity, and because few Republican incumbents face competitive races of their own. Reuters analyzed the 2021 campaign finance disclosures of 142 House Republicans who are running for re-election in November and were in office throughout the last election cycle. The analysis included both re-election funds and those raised by leadership committees, which lawmakers use to finance other political activities. The analysis focused on the House of Representatives where most Republicans voted against certifying Biden's victory, compared to only eight Republicans in the Senate. Fundraising by the House Republicans remains robust - about $200 million in 2021. Both objectors and non-objectors to Biden's win brought in more money than in 2019. Corporate dollars - which don't come directly from company coffers but are contributed by employees to fundraising groups controlled by the corporations - made up about a tenth of that 2021 amount. Their role in campaign finance has diminished over the last decade as the advent of online fundraising has made it easy to solicit donations from rank-and-file voters. read more Lawmakers who objected to Biden's 2020 victory raised around $9 million from corporate groups in 2021, less than half of the roughly $19 million raised in 2019. Corporate money raised by those who did not object rose to about $14 million last year from nearly $13 million in 2019. NO REGRETS Even before the Jan. 6 attack, many companies steered clear of some of the most confrontational partisans. Representative Matt Gaetz, who frequently appeared on cable television to praise Trump, raised only about $30,000 from corporate sources in 2019, out of the $1 million he netted in total. He took in no money from corporate political action committees (PACs) in 2021 after voting to challenge the election results - but he raised about $4 million overall. His office did not respond to a request for comment. Others have taken a steeper hit. Representative Mike Kelly, a senior member of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, collected about $460,000 in corporate donations in 2019. But after the Pennsylvania Republican launched an unsuccessful lawsuit to overturn Biden's victory in his state and voted against certifying the election result on Jan. 6, he took in just over $110,000 in corporate donations last year - about 75% less. Melanie Brewer, Kelly's campaign manager, said he did not regret his vote. ""While fundraising was difficult for many Republicans in 2021, it was more important that he reflected the values and ideals of his district,"" she said. The chamber's top two Republicans, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, also saw steep drops in their corporate donations after voting against the Jan. 6 results. Neither responded to a request for comment. However, companies continue to give to Republican election accounts that will help the wider party, helping these accounts keep up with fundraising by Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $140 million overall in 2021, on par with the $146 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Both groups raised more in 2021 than in 2019. TECH, FINANCE FIRMS CUT OFF SUPPORT The drop in corporate support for those who challenged the election masks significant differences among industries. Eight of the largest corporate donors ahead of the 2020 election have cut off donations entirely to those who challenged the election results, records show. Those companies are all in technology, finance or consumer goods - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab Google, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) , opens new tab , Lowe's Companies Inc (LOW.N) , opens new tab , Morgan Stanley (MS.N) , opens new tab , Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) , opens new tab , Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) , opens new tab , Citigroup Inc (C.N) , opens new tab and General Electric Co . All either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment. Most of them announced in early 2021 they were suspending contributions to those who challenged the election results. Donating to those lawmakers ""could really incite a bunch of their key stakeholders - like employees, suppliers, customers and so on,"" said Russell Crook, an expert on corporate political activity at the University of Tennessee. Some announced boycotts, only to abandon them. Walmart Inc (WMT.N) , opens new tab , which did not make any contributions in 2021 to the objectors, gave them $10,000 in January, split between McCarthy, Scalise and two others who voted against accepting the results. Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company changed its stance because it felt it could better advocate for its interests ""by engaging with policymakers from both parties."" By contrast, many defense contractors, whose profits depend on spending decisions made in Congress, have continued their support of all Republicans, whether or not they challenged the election results. Two of them - Boeing Co (BA.N) , opens new tab and BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L) , opens new tab - actually increased their donations to those who voted to challenge the election. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment and BAE declined to comment. Rock Holdings Inc, the parent company of mortgage lender Rocket Mortgage, roughly doubled its contribution to objectors in 2021, to at least $97,000. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Boeing, BAE and Rock also increased donations to those who did not object to the election result. Some Republican lawmakers reacted angrily last year when corporate representatives told them they would not get their support, according to a Republican strategist who directs business donations to lawmakers. But those tensions have eased in recent months as Republicans have grown more confident of victory and less interested in picking fights with possible allies, the strategist said, speaking on condition of anonymity."

Speaking to Real America's Voice's Prime Time with Dr. Gina Loudon, Greene repeated her controversial remarks in which she accused GOP senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins of being ""pro pedophile"" because they announced they were going to vote to confirm President Joe Biden's pick for the Supreme Court. After once again making the same accusation while appearing on the show, Greene listed off a number of other issues raised by the GOP in order to attack those on the left, and those who support Jackson, including Disney's rebuke of the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill in Florida. ""The Democrats are the party of pedophiles, the Democrats are the party of Princess predators from Disney,"" Greene said. ""The Democrats are the party of elementary school teachers trying to transition their elementary school aged children and convince them they are different gender. This is the party of their identity, and their identity is the most disgusting, evil, horrible thing happening in our country. ""I don't even care about Murkowski and Collins and Romney getting offended, but I hope the people in their states call them out for being pro pedophile and voting for Ketanji Brown Jackson,"" she added. ""Because I find that absolutely repulsive and I think most people do too."" The accusation that those who support Jackson are ""pro pedophile"" stems from a line of attack spearheaded by Josh Hawley during Jackson's confirmation hearing in which the Missouri Senator accused the judge of being too lenient when sentencing child sex offenders. Hawley's claims were widely labeled as misleading by fact checkers, with Andrew C. McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor and contributing editor at the conservative magazine National Review, describing Hawley's line of questioning as ""meritless to the point of demagoguery."" The attack has also been accused of ""pandering"" to supporters of QAnon, the far-right movement which believed that Donald Trump was secretly fighting a cabal of satanic child abusers, which included leading Democrat figures, during his time as president. Greene herself was a supporter of the conspiracy theory which is listed as a domestic terrorist threat by the FBI. In an August 2017 video, Greene described how there's ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles."" Greene, who has also wrongly once believed the Sandy Hook and Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shootings were fake, later disavowed QAnon and said she was allowed to ""believe things that weren't true."" Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Sophia Moskalenko, author and psychologist who specializes in radicalization and extremism, said Hawley, Greene and others in the GOP are trying to appeal to QAnon with their attacks on Jackson. ""They're pandering to the base and specifically to white suburban women who responded to QAnon content very strongly in the run-up to the presidential election,"" she said. A similar sentiment was made by Olivia Troye, a former White House official who worked as an aide for Vice President Mike Pence, after Romney confirmed he would be voting to confirm Jackson. ""If there was ever any doubt that GOP Senators Cruz, Hawley, Lee, etc., purposely misled Americans & blew the QAnon dog whistle during Judge Jackson's nomination hearing to stir up their base, just take a look at the comments in response to Mitt Romney's tweet supporting her,"" she tweeted. In a statement to Newsweek, Greene's spokesman, Nick Dyer, said the congresswoman is ""calling it like she sees it."" ""Ketanji Brown Jackson has been pandering to pedophiles for years with her rulings as a judge. Democrat activists turn to baseless smears when they can't deny the truth. The truth is KBJ has a soft spot for pedophiles and her leniency is evidence of it."""
/r/politics/comments/twum0c/conservatives_are_smearing_dont_say_gay_opponents/,1649164235,https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear,23380,Conservatives Are Smearing ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äô Opponents as Pedophile ‚ÄòGroomers‚Äô,"Tom Ammiano has heard rhetoric like this before. Ammiano was teaching in San Francisco when he came out as gay the mid-1970s during a fight for workplace protections. “The name-calling was not only on the playground but within the teachers lounge,” Ammiano told VICE News. Social conservatives soon launched a statewide campaign to bar gay and lesbian people from working in California public schools, warning that they were trying to “recruit” children to the “gay lifestyle” and prey on them sexually. Those pushing for the ban weren’t subtle with their message, naming their organization “Defend Our Children.” Now, as social conservatives introduce a raft of anti-LGBTQ legislation focused on classrooms and LGBTQ teens, like Florida’s new “Don’t Say Gay” law, they’ve resurrected some rhetoric that’s strikingly similar to that used during the 1978 campaign that Ammiano, Harvey Milk, Sally Miller Gearhart, and many others organized to defeat. They claim that anyone who mentions LGBTQ issues in the classroom is sexually “grooming” children, conflating a term that’s long been used to describe pedophiles training kids to accept their sexual assault to smear their opponents as sexual predators. “There’s a kind of a déjà vu,” said Ammiano, who later was elected as a Democrat to the San Francisco board of supervisors and the California state assembly. “These people are insinuating that you're going to come into the classroom and expose your genitals and talk about sex acts.” Meet the new right, same as the old right When LGBTQ activists effectively branded Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ Parental Rights in Education bill the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, DeSantis’ allies fired back by accusing them of supporting “grooming.” “The bill that liberals inaccurately call 'Don't Say Gay' would be more accurately described as an Anti-Grooming Bill,” DeSantis Press Secretary Christina Pushaw tweeted in March. “ If you’re against the Anti-Grooming Bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don’t denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.” DeSantis hasn’t used the term himself, but his language hasn’t been far off. Flanked by signs reading “protect children” as he signed the bill into law last week, DeSantis claimed those who oppose the bill support “sexualizing kids in kindergarten.” Similar bills have been filed by Republican lawmakers in other states—and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pledged to introduce a national version last Wednesday, declaring, “I will do anything I can to protect kids.” Social conservatives didn’t sound that different back in the ’70s. In 1978, California Republican state Sen. John Briggs, the proposition’s author, framed that debate as “whether or not we’re going to have homosexuals teaching immorality in the classrooms of this country.” “We cannot prevent child molestation, so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group [of teachers],” Briggs said during one TV debate. Briggs’ initiative was modeled on singer and anti-gay-rights activist Anita Bryant’s “Save Our Children” campaign, which successfully repealed an anti-discrimination law in Dade County, Florida, that protected gays and lesbians. “What these people really want, hidden behind obscure legal phrases, is the legal right to propose to our children that theirs is an acceptable alternate way of life,” Bryant claimed then. “As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children.” Cathryn Oakley, the senior counsel of the pro-LGTBQ Human Rights Campaign, said the rhetoric she’s hearing now from legislators pushing anti-LGBTQ bills is “the same stuff” as homophobic attacks from decades past—just repackaged. “What they think is appealing in the moment is implying that kids aren't actually trans, that they can't actually be LGBTQ unless someone is making them be that way,” she told VICE News. “Whether that's their teachers, whether that's something they see in their schoolbooks, whether it's their doctors and their parents ‘forcing’ gender-affirming care on them—that it's not an authentic identity to be respected. It's something that's being pushed and peddled and groomed.” Ammiano sees a clear political reason why groups now are seeking to connect trans and gay people to the toxic term. “This is a great fundraiser, a great cash cow,” Ammiano said. “Children are always a good element to use to get people's blood boiling or to convince them that they're in danger.” The American Principles Project, one of the main organizations pushing this raft of new legislation, deployed the word “groomed” in a recent fundraising plea. “The Left wants to sexualize YOUR CHILDREN—even in the classroom,” the group declared. “Thankfully, Governor DeSantis passed legislation to protect children from being groomed and sexualized by the Left. However, this means only children in FLORIDA are safe—there are still 49 STATES where this kind of abuse is still legal.” American Principles Project President Terry Schilling defended his group’s rhetoric and claimed to VICE News that there’s a “new generation of public school teachers who are hellbent on grooming these kids to be LGBT citizens.” “Maybe it’s a little bit different from a pedophile specifically grooming a child for their own sexual gratification, but this is a form of grooming,” Schilling said. “We have all different types of definitions of rape, right? There’s date-rape, there’s all types of rape. So I think this is a type of grooming, grooming children to be sexually active at the youngest ages. And it’s crazy to me.” The Oxford English Dictionary defines grooming as “ the action by a pedophile of preparing a child for a meeting, especially via an internet chat room, with the intention of committing a sexual offense.” The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), the country’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, defines it as “manipulative behaviors that the abuser uses to gain access to a potential victim, coerce them to agree to the abuse, and reduce the risk of being caught.” ‘Call them groomers and pedophiles’ This language is pulled straight out of an old social-conservative political playbook. The first prong of their argument is the claim that LGBTQ people are sexual predators, even though scientific studies have shown that straight and cisgender adults are just as likely to be child abusers as LGBTQ adults. The other longtime “grooming” argument echoes another social conservative scare tactic: that the “gay agenda” involves recruiting children. Conservatives clearly believe the latest version of this attack has potency. “Call them groomers and pedophiles if they oppose it. Put THEM on the defensive. Make THEM afraid. Make THEM avoid talking about it,” nationally syndicated radio show host Jesse Kelly tweeted last month. “You have the high ground. Use it to destroy your enemy.” Fox News host Laura Ingraham did a whole segment on the term, with the on-screen text reading “Liberals are sexually grooming elementary students.” Prominent conservative radio host and blogger Erick Erickson declared, “Progressives really are becoming groomers of children.” And just like in the ’70s, conservatives are framing the debate as a question of parental rights. “Parents’ rights have been increasingly under assault around the nation,” DeSantis declared at last week’s bill signing, arguing that the law’s opponents “support enabling schools to transition students to a different gender without the knowledge of the parent.” That sounds a lot like Briggs, who claimed his proposition would protect “the rights of parents to determine who will be a proper role model for their children in the California classroom.” Some of those using the term argue they’re not talking specifically about LGBTQ people when they use the term “grooming.” “I have never once singled out LGBTQ people, because groomers (child predators) can be of any orientation or identity,” Pushaw, DeSantis’ press secretary, told VICE News in an email. “Your assumption that criticism of grooming is criticism of the LGBTQ community equates LGBTQ people to groomers, which is both bigoted and inaccurate. Do better. And, any adult who wants to discuss sexual and gender identity topics with other people’s 5- to 8-year-old children—while keeping this a secret from their parents—is either a groomer or is complicit in promoting an environment where grooming becomes normalized.”__Pushaw said the law doesn’t “single out or mention LGBTQ people,” which is technically true but misleading—the bill specifically prohibits “classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity” for children in third grade or younger. Anti-trans bills reach an all-time high Schilling’s organization, along with the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Heritage Foundation, have been behind a significant upsurge in state-level legislation to eliminate protections for gay and trans youth or ban discussion of LGBTQ issues in public schools. At least 166 anti-LGBTQ bills across the country are currently under consideration, according to Freedom for All Americans, including 75 bills that, like Florida’s, seek to limit what can be discussed in classrooms. The language of the Florida law is vague, seemingly designed to discourage any talk of LGBTQ issues at any stage of public education. The Human Rights Campaign tracked an all-time high of 79 anti-trans bills in 2019. That record didn’t last long—there were 150 bills in 2021, and more than 130 have already been filed this year. Social conservatives claim their nationwide efforts are aimed at protecting children. But many of their bills specifically target LGBTQ youth, such as barring trans youth from high school athletics or preventing them from accessing gender-affirming medical care. The Florida law explicitly bans “discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity” in classrooms for students through third grade and bars discussion of the topic that isn’t “age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate” for older students. ADVERTISEMENT The onslaught of legislation is scaring LGBTQ youth, who face disproportionately high depression and anxiety rates and are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people. Two-thirds of all LGBTQ youth—and 85 percent of trans and nonbinary youth—said recent debates about state laws restricting the rights of transgender people have negatively affected their mental health, according to recent Morning Consult polling for the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ suicide and crisis-prevention organization. Two in five LGBTQ youth had “seriously considered” suicide in the past year, according to a late-2021 survey from the organization. Casey Pick, the Trevor Project’s senior fellow for advocacy and government affairs, said that many kids who’ve reached out to the organization’s 24/7 crisis hotline and forums have brought up the surge in legislation and the “grooming” rhetoric around it. “They tell us that they are contemplating self-harm or suicidality because of the hostile environment they find themselves in,” she told VICE News. “This rhetoric is dangerous, and it's a throwback. LGBTQ people have been wrongly accused of preying on children for decades,” she continued. “[Grooming] is a word that has tremendous power and is incredibly dangerous.” Schilling called the high rates of suicide and depression among LGBTQ youth “tragic,” but he argued it was because pro-LGBTQ people tell them “your body is wrong, and you need to alter it in order for you to not commit suicide.” But a peer-reviewed study conducted by the Trevor Project found that trans youth were much less likely to contemplate suicide if their family and community affirmed their gender. The American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics both support access to gender-affirming medical care for trans youth because it saves lives. Pick personally knows the lasting impact institutional hostility to LGBTQ youth can create. She said when she came out as gay in high school, her mother kicked her out of the house and changed the locks. She spent her senior year sleeping on her best friend’s floor. Her grades tanked from the stress, and she had to attend junior college for a year before she could transfer to college. She says that even elementary school–aged children have been reaching out to the Trevor Project’s crisis lines—both kids who are LGBTQ themselves and kids with LGBTQ parents. “There's no age that is too young to talk about welcoming and affirming LGBTQ young people,” she said. “They deserve to be able to talk about their families and include their families in their education, same as any of their peers. We're not a threat. We're just people. And we deserve the same rights and dignities and opportunities as anybody else.”"

Another House floor vote on the newly introduced version of this bill is an urgent step towards advancing long overdue reform in the criminal legal system and beyond. When the bill passed, it was the first time that a body of Congress voted to end the federal prohibition of marijuana – a policy that has led to the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of people. It also tears apart families when immigrants – often vital community members – are arrested and then deported for marijuana possession. Ending marijuana prohibition would be a much-needed move toward a US drug policy grounded in human rights, harm reduction, and health. Human Rights Watch has long documented the profound racial disparities in arrests and imprisonment for drug offenses in the United States. In a 2016 report, “Every 25 Seconds: The Human Toll of Criminalizing Drug Use in the United States,” Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented how someone in the US was arrested for drug possession for personal use every 25 seconds, and that despite using drugs at similar rates as white people, Black adults were more than two-and-a-half times more likely to be arrested for possession. Of these drug arrests, the largest share by far are marijuana related. Increasing legalization of marijuana at the state level has resulted in significant reductions in marijuana arrests in multiple states. However, while marijuana arrests have dropped nationally in recent years, there were still an estimated 350,150 arrests for marijuana-related violations in the United States in 2020, roughly one arrest every 90 seconds. The overwhelming majority were for simple possession. And as a recent report by the ACLU shows, racial disparities in marijuana arrests for both possession and sales remain acute. The MORE Act is a step toward a rights-respecting criminal legal system that furthers racial justice and equity. The bill would end federal marijuana prohibition, address the collateral consequences of criminalization, and take steps to repair the harms caused by the war on drugs on many communities in the US. Members of Congress should heed the call of a diverse coalition of organizations and cosponsor the bill. House Leadership should immediately bring the bill to the floor for a vote.

Ron DeSantis (R) on Friday warned of a coming “Cold War” between Florida and Georgia if Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams wins the gubernatorial election in the latter state. During a press conference in Gulf County, located in northwest Florida, DeSantis referenced the ongoing Masters golf tournament in Georgia, using it as an apparent segue into discussing the state’s elections. DeSantis said he “really appreciates our Georgians” but that voters would have to “take care” of the 2022 election to prevent Abrams from winning. “If Stacey Abrams is elected governor of Georgia, I just want to be honest, that will be a cold war between Florida and Georgia,” he said. “I can’t have [former Cuban communist leader Raul] Castro to my south and Abrams to my north, that would be a disaster. So I hope you guys take care of that and we’ll end up in good shape.” The Hill has reached out to DeSantis’s office for comment. Abrams, a former state House minority leader who previously ran for governor, is running uncontested in the Democratic primary field, but faces a competitive general election against incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and former Sen. David Perdue (R). According to the latest polling, Abrams trails Kemp by a 51 percent to 44 percent margin and Perdue by 49 percent to 44 percent margin. Kemp narrowly beat out Abrams for the governorship in 2018. DeSantis has become a major force in the Republican party and is flirting with a 2024 presidential run. The Democratic candidate and Republican governor couldn’t be further apart on many issues, including gun control, immigration and the LGBTQ community. DeSantis just signed the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill into law, which prohibits the discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation from kindergarten through third grade, which critics say marginalizes trans and LGBTQ youth, while Abrams’s campaign site says she wants to “nurture and protect” LGBTQ children."
/r/politics/comments/tqhrnw/the_trumps_did_business_with_an_oligarch_linked/,1648497219,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/03/donald-trump-baku-iran-revolutionary-guard/,22348,The Trumps Did Business With an Oligarch Linked to Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard. They‚Äôd Like You to Forget.,"As part of the ongoing negotiations to revive the Iran nuclear deal, diplomats have floated the possibility of removing the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps from the United States’ official list of terrorist groups. That would be a controversial step, and the matter is far from settled. But many on the right are enraged by the idea. Last week, one of the most ironic complaints came from Donald Trump’s son. In 2018, Trump scuttled the agreement that the Obama administration had negotiated to halt Iran’s nuclear weapons program. The following year, the Trump administration declared that the Revolutionary Guard—a key part of Iran’s military—was a terrorist organization. Now Don Jr. seems furious that the Biden administration might change course. The irony is that a decade ago, the Trump family—eager to strike a profitable hotel deal—worked closely with a billionaire oligarch who apparently had close ties to the Revolutionary Guard. In 2012, the elder Trump inked a deal in Baku, the capital of the natural-gas rich, but incredibly corrupt, former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. It was set up to be extremely lucrative for the Trumps—they would get big upfront payments for their involvement, would get a lot of say into the design of the hotel, and then would collect royalties and management fees over time. Trump’s Azeri partners would fund the construction of the building and actually own the project. His partners were the Mammadovs, a prominent Azeri family headed by the country’s then-transportation minister, Ziya Mammadov, who, despite his modest government salary and background as a Soviet railroad system apparatchik—a Communist Party functionary—was reportedly worth billions. The Trumps worked closely with Mammadov’s playboy son, Anar Mammadov. As I wrote in 2015, there were a lot of red flags that should have been obvious when it came to working with the Mammadovs: In an article titled “The Corleones of the Caspian,” Foreign Policy reported that the “profit margins” of [Anar] Mammadov’s Garant [corporation] “appear inextricably linked to a number of sweetheart contracts signed with his father’s Transport Ministry.” One of Mammadov’s other companies has received over $1 billion in highway construction contracts, and the firm owns many of Baku’s buses and taxis. Until 2013, Mammadov owned a majority stake in the bank that processed all of the taxi cab fares and the company that provided insurance to all the cabs. According to Foreign Policy, the company that Trump is working with also secured the contract to construct the Baku bus station, which Mammadov’s uncle owns. A leaked diplomatic cable on Azerbaijan’s “most powerful families,” drafted in 2010 by the charge d’affairs at the US embassy in Baku, noted: “With so much of the nation’s oil wealth being poured into road construction, the Mammadovs also control a significant source of rent-seeking.” The New Yorker documented further details of the Mammadovs’ background at the time Trump did business with them, including the fact that the Mammadovs were known to have a close relationship with an Iranian Revolutionary Guard-linked family called the Darvishis: At least three Darvishis—the brothers Habil, Kamal, and Keyumars—appear to be associates of the Guard. In Farsi press accounts, Habil, who runs the Tehran Metro Company, is referred to as a sardar, a term for a senior officer in the Revolutionary Guard. A cable sent on March 6, 2009, from the U.S. Embassy in Baku described Kamal as having formerly run “an alleged Revolutionary Guard-controlled business in Iran.” The company, called Nasr, developed and acquired instruments, guidance systems, and specialty metals needed to build ballistic missiles. In 2007, Nasr was sanctioned by the U.S. for its role in Iran’s effort to develop nuclear missiles. The cable said that Kamal and Keyumars were frequent visitors to Azerbaijan; Kamal had recently established “a close business relationship/friendship” with Ziya Mammadov, and, with Mammadov’s assistance, had been awarded “at least eight major road construction and rehabilitation contracts, including contracts for construction of the Baku-Iranian Astara highway.” (Keyumars also seems to have been involved in these deals.) The cable added, “We assume Mammedov [sic] is a silent partner in these contracts.” Despite the fact that the Trumps’ management deal with the Mammadovs required that they have significant say in the work being done on the hotel, the Trumps apparently didn’t know or didn’t care that their partners were so closely connected with the group that Donald Trump Jr. was railing against last week. Ivanka Trump posted videos of herself at the time enjoying her visits to Baku, where she was scrutinizing work on the hotel to ensure it was up to Trump standards. And Trump Jr. proudly promoted the project himself: Don Jr., it seems, has conveniently forgotten that his own family’s eagerness for this deal netted his father at least $2.8 million. Sadly, for the Trumps, the Baku hotel deal fell apart somewhere along the line. In the early months of the elder Trump’s presidential campaign, his company was ramping up promotions of the hotel. But by the time he took office, it had been disappeared from the Trump Organization’s website. It never opened. The Mammadovs’ building was last seen catching fire in 2018."
/r/politics/comments/tpvfly/ketanji_brown_jackson_is_the_most_popular_supreme/,1648421836,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/26/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-biden/index.html,22062,Ketanji Brown Jackson is the most popular Supreme Court nominee in years,"Two news stories dominated the headlines this week. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine reached its one month mark. And the Senate hosted confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to join the Supreme Court. It’s with the Jackson confirmation hearings that we begin our statistical journey into the news of the week. Jackson in the court of popular opinion Five recent surveys have indicated strong support for President Joe Biden’s decision to nominate Jackson for the Supreme Court seat retiring Justice Stephen Breyer is vacating. According to an average of polls by Gallup, Fox, Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University and the Pew Research Center, about 53% of Americans supported her confirmation, with about 26% of Americans opposed. This is good for a +27-point net popularity rating. If Jackson’s ratings hold up through her likely confirmation, she would be the most popular nominee to be confirmed since John Roberts in 2005. Jackson’s popularity should only help her in the confirmation process. A few years ago, I built a statistical model to help understand why senators vote the way they do on Supreme Court nominees. The model took into account variables such as a nominee’s qualifications, the ideology of the nominee and the senator, etc. One of the factors I included was public sentiment about a nominee. Holding everything else equal, nominees got more votes when they were more popular with the public. Clarence Thomas, for example, was generally viewed in 1991 as very conservative and not as well qualified as many earlier nominees. Yet, Thomas was confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate. A lot of that may have had to do with the fact that he was popular. Thomas had a +33-point net popularity rating among Americans, according to an average of polling taken before he was confirmed. Jackson could join Roberts as the only Supreme Court nominees this century to achieve a popularity level anywhere near where Thomas was some 30 years ago. Indeed, one of the big stories of Supreme Court nominations this century is how divisive they’ve generally been with the American public. Since 2005, nominees who either got a Senate vote or withdrew their nominations averaged only a +10-point net popularity rating in their final polls. Compare that with nominees from 1986 to 1994, who averaged a +26-point net popularity rating in their final polls before their Senate vote or withdrawal of their nomination. This strong popularity for earlier nominees helps, at least in small part, to explain why most of them flew through their confirmation hearings and why many this century have generally had a harder time. Of course, we probably shouldn’t expect Jackson to get anywhere near the number of votes Roberts got from senators (78). The Senate has grown more polarized in general, with senators less likely to cross the aisle over the last 30 years – more so over the last 15 to 20 years. That’s another big reason why even confirmed Supreme Court nominees are getting fewer “yes” votes than they used to. Still, it would be surprising if Jackson didn’t get at least a few Republican votes. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio seem the most likely given how often they’ve voted with Biden this Congress. The good news for Democrats is that even if Jackson doesn’t get any Republican votes, the polarization would still help her. It is unlikely that any Democrat will vote against her. With the Senate Democratic Caucus controlling 50 seats and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking any tie votes, all Jackson needs for confirmation is Democratic support. Don’t forget about the economy The Jackson confirmation hearings and the Russian invasion of the Ukraine are basically all you see on cable tv right now. From Monday through Wednesday this week, there were over 4,300 mentions of “Ukraine” and over 1,400 mentions of “Supreme Court” across CNN, Fox News and MSNBC, per the Internet Archive’s Television News Archive. There were just 220 mentions of inflation by comparison. Yet, that’s what voters care the most about. In a CBS News/YouGov poll from earlier this month, 46% said the “economy and jobs” or “inflation” were the most important issues facing the country. No other issue came close. This could explain why there’s been a minimal “rally around the flag” effect for Biden following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the President’s approval rating seemed to rise by a point or two initially, any rise has since flattened out. Biden’s average approval rating stands in the low 40s with a disapproval rating in the mid 50s. Notably, Biden’s approval rating on the economy has been stuck in the high 30s with little sign of movement over the past month. In contrast, his approval rating on the Russia-Ukraine situation has risen over the past month. This rise has had little impact on his overall approval rating. The importance of the economy to voters has been clear throughout Biden’s term so far. His overall approval ratings have tracked closely with his ratings on the economy, which have ranged from the high 50s to the upper 30s. The fact that the economy has remained important to determining the temperature of the electorate shouldn’t be surprising. Even with a global pandemic, the 2020 election result tracked well with what would have been expected with a lackluster, though not awful, economy. It’s a reminder that what dominates the airwaves doesn’t necessarily dominate the minds on Main Street. For your brief encounters: Did you know the Academy Awards are on Sunday night? I asked two friends whether they would be watching the Oscars this weekend. Neither knew it was actually on. I can’t say I’m shocked. While more than 40 million people watched the Academy Awards in 2014, viewership has been on decline in recent years. About 10 million people watched last year. I covered this and other statistics about the Oscars (including who is favored to win) in a recent article. Check it out if you, like my friends, aren’t up to snuff on what was once a cultural touchstone. Last week’s results: I asked you all what you were more looking forward to watching – the NCAA basketball tournament or the start of the Major League Baseball season? A plurality of respondents were more into the NCAA tourney. – though the comments in support didn’t exactly represent a ringing endorsement for the most part. “I really don’t care much about college ball, but as a reds fan, I care about baseball that much less,” @its_kduff said. There were some baseball backers as well. Here’s what @DillonRae96 had to say: “Personally MLB season, grew up in Tucson so the college basketball culture was absolutely shoved in your face at every turn.” Of course, a few of you fell into neither camp. Like soccer fan @srneal3, who noted, “The MLS and NWSL seasons just started.” Leftover polls In-person worship services: A new poll from the Pew Research Center showed that 43% of those who attend religious services once a month said the house of worship they attend most often is open the same way it was before the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2021, it was just 12%. Early midterm poll accuracy: A review of gubernatorial and Senate polls since 1998 by FiveThirtyEight has a mixed bag of news of those hoping to forecast the future. While either side has about an equal chance of winning races that are polling within 5 points at this stage of the cycle, the side that is ahead wins about 75% of races when they are up 5 to 10 points and about 90% of races when they have a lead of 10 points or more. Helping others: A Gallup study found strong growth across the world in people helping strangers, volunteering time to organizations and donating money to charities over the course of the pandemic, with participation in such activities increasing by nearly 25%."
/r/politics/comments/tg0csj/america_cant_afford_to_forget_zelenskyys_role_in/,1647486045,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-s-zelenskyy-call-key-point-amid-russia-s-ukraine-n1291960,21093,America can't afford to forget Zelenskyy's role in Trump's first impeachment,"It was the summer of 2019. A soon-to-be whistleblower was stunned to learn about a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A White House lawyer, after learning about the president’s remarks, took a step that was at odds with White House policy: He buried the transcript of the call in an encrypted computer system used for national security information, where it was unlikely to come to light. Today, the Ukrainian president is being lauded as a hero by his people and pundits. He is in close contact with President Joe Biden, and will be speaking with Congress on Wednesday, where he is sure to receive a bipartisan ovation. But many Americans have seemingly forgotten the role Zelenskyy played in the events of Trump’s first impeachment, and how those events foreshadowed today. If we forget this history, we’re doomed to repeat its mistakes. The first impeachment is pivotal to understanding the current war in Ukraine, and how narrowly we escaped an American presidency that could have readily aligned itself with Russia over our NATO allies. On July 25, 2019, Trump called Zelenskyy to congratulate him on his recent parliamentary victory. But the call went off script. Trump told Zelenskyy that European allies weren’t doing enough to support Ukraine. Zelenskyy agreed, thanked Trump for past support and said Ukraine was almost ready to acquire more Javelins, a defensive weapon Ukrainians could use against invading tanks. Trump’s response was entirely unexpected. According to notes from the call, Trump told Zelenskyy, “I would like you to do us a favor though.” Trump wanted Zelenskyy to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, for corruption stemming from Hunter’s work on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian company. Trump hinted that the former vice president could be complicit in the corruption, falsely claiming Biden had bragged about stopping an investigation into his son. Trump told Zelenskyy he’d arrange calls for him with both Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. Giuliani had already been pressuring Zelenskyy to open an investigation into the baseless theory that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election. Giuliani also pushed the Biden corruption allegations. Never mind that the timeline didn’t work in Trump’s favor. As retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman writes in his book, Burisma was investigated during the Obama administration but the alleged misconduct transpired before Hunter Biden joined the board. There was no indication he or his father were involved. And yet, Trump later called it “a perfect phone call.” Zelenskyy was unaware that there was a problem with the approximately $400 million in aid Congress had appropriated for Ukraine. In fact, before the call, Trump had asked his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to hold back the aid. Members of Congress who inquired about the delay were told that it was part of an “interagency process” and members of the administration were instructed not to provide any additional information. If none of this had come to light, it’s possible Ukraine may have given in. But the call did come to light. The inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson (subsequently fired by Trump, in April 2020) advised the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the director of national intelligence was sitting on a credible whistleblower complaint. The committee had to subpoena the director's office, but it finally received the complaint. Trump then released a five-page summary of the call. His own version was so damaging that he was still impeached. Barr seems to have known the whistleblower complaint was bad news from the time he got wind of it. Once the intelligence community inspector general deemed the allegations in the complaint both urgent and credible, Congress would normally have been alerted. But it wasn’t, because the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion that overruled the inspector general and forced the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to withhold the complaint. Barr’s DOJ not only tried to keep the whistleblower complain out of sight, it declined to conduct a criminal investigation, concluding there was no crime because Trump hadn’t “sought a thing of value.” It wasn’t until after the White House learned about the whistleblower complaint that Ukraine finally received the aid Congress had approved months earlier. Ukraine’s national security, which is tied to American’s national security, took a backseat to Trump’s re-election ambitions. If none of this had come to light, it’s possible Ukraine may have given in. But the call did come to light. Trump now takes credit for the aid Ukraine received and suggests that if he were president, Ukraine would be better off. Indeed, 62 percent of Americans believe Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump were president. But believing Trump means putting aside reality. Trump is the president who demanded the translator’s notes after a 2017 conversation with Putin. He is the president who kept concealed, even in classified records, details of five face-to-face interactions with the Russian president from 2017 to 2019. Trump, over the course of his presidency, was increasingly hostile to NATO. At the same time, he was smitten with men like Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, and Putin. Trump is not the champion of besieged democracies. His initial instinct was to call Putin’s actions “genius” and characterize his description of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border as peacekeepers as “very savvy.” We are fortunate Congress got wind of the whistleblower complaint and made it public. We are equally fortunate to have heard the testimony of people like Vindman and former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovich. But, while the House impeached Trump, the Senate acquitted him. Among Republicans, only Mitt Romney of Utah acknowledged the facts. The Republican Party gave Trump a pass. And Trump was clearly emboldened by his acquittal, going on to concoct an election fraud fantasy — well before the election took place and it would have been possible to know fraud was occurring. His anger when he lost erupted into a tantrum that propelled a crowd toward the Capitol and violence on Jan. 6. Had he won, Trump could have fully denuded NATO and entered into once discussed joint cyber agreements with Moscow. We could have had a president who wouldn’t protest Putin’s Ukraine ambitions; after all, as Trump said originally, they were “smart.” We could still have a return of that president, with Trump hinting once again over the weekend that he will be a candidate in 2024. The same Trump, with a desperate desire to retake the White House and a willingness to sacrifice national interests to get there. Americans’ memories have seemingly gotten shorter and shorter. But if we are to avoid future disaster, we cannot forget the events — the facts — of July 2019."

Data for Progress, in collaboration with Rise — a higher education advocacy group — conducted a survey obtained exclusively by Insider of 2,066 likely voters in the battleground states Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which flipped from former President Donald Trump to President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Respondents were polled on how likely they would be to vote in the November general election should Biden implement a range of policy measures related to student debt, and it found that 45% of them would be somewhat or much more likely to vote if Biden cancels $10,000 in student debt for every federal borrower, which he pledged to do on the campaign trail. Additionally, 46% of respondents also said they would be likelier to go to the polls if Biden were to cancel $50,000 in student debt for every federal borrower — an amount many progressives lawmakers have been pushing for. Over one-third of respondents said another motivating factor to vote would come from a further extension of the pause on student-loan payments through the end of the year. Student-loan payments have been paused for over two years, with waived interest, and they're set to resume in one month, on May 1. While Republican lawmakers have been urging Biden against another extension of that pause, Democrats have argued that federal borrowers need continued relief, and the president should either extend the pause a fourth time, or cancel some amount of student debt before borrowers have to resume repayment. Chair of the Senate education committee Patty Murray, for example, recommended that Biden extend the pause on student-loan payments through at least 2023 to give him time to ""permanently fix"" flaws in the student-loan industry, like broken loan-forgiveness programs. 43 Democratic lawmakers recently said both borrowers and the Education Department are ""unprepared"" to resume in payments in May. ""Millions of borrowers have benefitted from the pause in payments,"" the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden. ""Although progress has been made, we believe it is vital to ensure that we continue to work to alleviate the continued impact the pandemic is having on families across the country."" According to the survey, 55% of respondents said they trust the Democratic Party more to provide student debt relief, but lawmakers in that party have expressed concerns with voter turnout should they fail to deliver on progressive priorities. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in December it would be ""actually delusional"" to think Democrats could win elections if they fail to follow through on voter priorities. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in January that canceling student debt ""would persuade a lot of young people that this president is in the fight for them."" Borrowers are still waiting to hear from the president on any student-debt forgiveness plans with the payment resumption just a month away as pressure continues to mount for Biden to take decisive action on the issue."
/r/politics/comments/tjlond/its_time_to_confront_the_trumpputin_network/,1647895836,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/time-to-confront-trump-putin-network,20221,It‚Äôs time to confront the Trump-Putin network,"In 2014, the Putin regime invaded Ukraine’s Crimea. In 2016, the same regime invaded the United States. The former took place as a conventional military operation; the latter was a spectacular case of cyberwarfare, including disinformation that it was happening at all and promulgation of a lot of talking points still devoutly repeated by many. It was a vast social-media influencing project that took many forms as it sought to sow discord and confusion, even attempting to dissuade Black voters from voting. Additionally, Russian intelligence targeted voter rolls in all 50 states, which is not thought to have had consequences, but demonstrated the reach and ambition of online interference. This weekend, British investigative journalist Carole Cadwalladr said on Twitter, “We failed to acknowledge Russia had staged a military attack on the West. We called it ‘meddling.’ We used words like ‘interference.’ It wasn’t. It was warfare. We’ve been under military attack for eight years now.” As she notes, Putin’s minions were not only directing their attention to the United States, and included pro-Brexit efforts and support for France’s far-right racist National Front party. The US interference – you could call it cyberwarfare, or informational invasion – took many forms. Stunningly, a number of left-wing news sources and pundits devoted themselves to denying the reality of the intervention and calling those who were hostile to the Putin regime cold-war red-scare right-wingers, as if contemporary Russia was a glorious socialist republic rather than a country ruled by a dictatorial ex-KGB agent with a record of murdering journalists, imprisoning dissenters, embezzling tens of billions and leading a global neofascist white supremacist revival. In discrediting the news stories and attacking critics of the Russian government, they provided crucial cover for Trump. In her 2019 testimony to House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, former National Security Agency staffer Fiona Hill declared, “Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details must remain classified. The impact of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being torn apart; truth is questioned; our highly professional expert career Foreign Service is being undermined. US support for Ukraine, which continues to face armed aggression, is being politicized. President Putin and the Russian security services aim to counter US foreign policy objectives in Europe, including in Ukraine, where Moscow wishes to reassert political and economic dominance.” The assertions of interference were compelling all along. On 7 October 2016, US intelligence agencies released a bombshell press release declaring “The US Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.” In one of the weirdest days in US political history, the Access Hollywood tape of Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women was released half an hour later, and half an hour after that, “WikiLeaks began tweeting links to emails hacked from the personal account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.” WikiLeaks is thought to have gotten its material from the Russian intelligence agency GRU; longtime Republican operative and Trump ally Roger Stone appears to have been a liaison between WikiLeaks and the Trump team. On 30 October 2016, then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid put out a furious letter to then-FBI director James Comey, charging “it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity.” He demanded, unsuccessfully, that Comey publicize this information. On 31 October, Obama called Putin on the nuclear risk reductions hotline to demand he stop this interference, but the public didn’t know about this until after Trump had lost the popular vote but won the electoral college. Of course the most striking role of the Russian government in the 2016 US election was its many, many ties with the Trump campaign, including with Trump himself, who spent the campaign and the four years of his presidency groveling before Putin, denying the reality of Russian interference, and changing first the Republican platform and then US policy to serve Putin’s agendas. This included cutting support for Ukraine against Russia out of the Republican platform when he won the primary, considerable animosity toward Nato, and ultimately trying to blackmail Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in 2019 by withholding military aid while demanding he offer confirmation of a Russian conspiracy theory blaming Ukraine rather than Russia for 2016 election interference. A stunning number of Trump’s closest associates had deep ties to the Russian government. They included Paul Manafort, who during his years in Ukraine worked to build Russian influence there and served as a consultant to the Kremlin-backed Ukrainian president who was driven out of the country – and into Russia by popular protest in 2014 (the Russian line is that this was an illegitimate coup and thus a justification for invasion is still widely repeated). Manafort was, during his time in the campaign, sharing data with Russian intelligence agent Konstantin V Kilimnik, while campaign advisor Jeff Sessions was sharing information with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Manafort, Donald Trump Jr and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner held an illegal meeting in Trump Tower with a Kremlin-linked lawyer on 9 June 2016, where they were promised damaging material on the Clinton campaign. After being seated next to Putin while being paid to speak at a dinner celebrating RT, Russia’s news propaganda outlet, Michael Flynn briefly became Trump’s national security advisor. He was soon was fired for lying to White House officials and later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Jared Kushner allegedly directed him to make those contacts and as the Washington Post reported in May 2017, “Jared Kushner and Russia’s ambassador to Washington discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump’s transition team and the Kremlin, using Russian diplomatic facilities in an apparent move to shield their pre-inauguration discussions from monitoring.” The Guardian reported the same year that “Donald Trump Jr has been forced to release damning emails that reveal he eagerly embraced what he was told was a Russian government attempt to damage Hillary Clinton’s election campaign.” What’s striking in retrospect is that all of this was made possible by corruption and amorality inside the United States. It was Silicon Valley’s mercenary amorality that created weapons and vulnerabilities and sat by pocketing the profit as they were exploited to destructive ends. It was corrupt Americans – from Manafort to Trump himself – that gave Putin his influence. It was international players such as WikiLeaks and Cambridge Analytica that helped. It was corruption of media outlets such as Fox News that continued – in Tucker Carlson’s case until last week’s invasion of Ukraine caught up with him – to defend Putin and spread disinformation. The Republican party met its new leader by matching his corruption, and by covering up his crimes and protecting him from consequences, including two impeachments. The second impeachment was for a violent invasion of Congress, not by a foreign power, but by right-wingers inflamed by lies instigated by Trump and amplified by many in the party. They have become willing collaborators in an attempt to sabotage free and fair elections, the rule of law, and truth itself."

Sabatini enthusiastically voted in favor of House Bill 1557, which critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, in February and has been one of its highest-profile proponents ever since Disney issued a March 28 decree saying its ""goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts."" In response, some lawmakers are threatening to reverse government favors that have benefited Disney since 1967, when Florida created something called the ""Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID)."" This gave Disney taxing and other privileges and allowed it to ""act with the same authority and responsibility as a county government,"" a favor that made sense to politicians at the time since Disney was promising to turn 38.5 square miles of ""largely uninhabited pasture and swampland into a global destination,"" according to the RCID website. ""When Disney purchased land for its theme parks, it pushed through laws that said it was self-governing,"" Sabatini told Newsweek. ""They have their own police and fire departments and could even have their own nuclear power plant if they wished. If it were up to me, I'd call a special session and Disney would lose all of it. If they're governed by local authorities, it's not going to be pretty for them—they'll be subject to all sorts of crazy taxes, rules and regulations. It will make life a living hell for them. They'll be regulated like everybody else."" DeSantis, in fact, signaled during a Thursday press conference that he's open to the idea of reversing special privileges that had been carved out for Disney, though repealing corporate state tax breaks are off the table since all businesses qualify for them. DeSantis said he'd be in favor of not allowing Disney ""to have their own set of rules compared to everybody else."" Such remarks seem to be an escalation of a feud that had largely been confined to the social issue of parental and LGBTQ rights, though now could have dramatic economic implications for both sides. Disney already weathered an employee walkout after workers said the company was too slow to speak against HB 1557 and many celebrities, including Mark Hamill of Disney's Star Wars franchise, have bashed Florida over its passage. Beyond Disney corporate, the Disney+ streaming service issued a separate March 22 statement against HB 1557 in part reading, ""We strongly denounce all legislation that infringes on the basic human rights of people in the LGBTQIA+ community—especially legislation that targets and harms young people and their families."" The seven-page bill boils down to the notion that ""classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."" But critics, like The Trevor Project, a mental health organization for LGBTQ youth, says the bill erases ""LGBTQ identity, history and culture"" and that ""vague parental notification requirements ... could effectively require teachers to 'out' LGBTQ students."" Such analysis is nonsense, says Sabatini. ""This bill is about K through third grade. Let me repeat: K through third—children ages 5, 6 and 7,"" he said. ""Disney's position is that these children need lessons about transgenderism and sexual orientation. If you need me to explain why that's wrong, it's a waste of my time, because it's so self-evident."" Disney did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment, but its March 28 statement to the press said that ""Florida's HB 1557, also known as the 'Don't Say Gay' bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law."" ""Disney is responding to radical, leftist nut-jobs in California. They're corporate cowards,"" Sabatini said. ""Disney is about to lose all its governing status in Florida. The hammer is going to drop so hard on Disney that they're in full defense mode. Really bad things are going to happen, and they're freaking out."""
