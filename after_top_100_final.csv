Stevens cites examples directly from the tome to prove that the Bible is too ÒwokeÓ to be available to young students. Over 200 books have been banned in the Sunshine State so far. The state Board of Education announced last week that it will reject 71% of elementary school math textbooks and 41% of textbooks for all grades. Officials say the curriculum contained Òprohibited contentÓ about Òcritical race theory.Ó DeSantis insisted the textbooks contained Òprohibited contentÓ that was meant to ÒindoctrinateÓ children. Asked to list examples from ÒwokeÓ math textbooks, DeSantisÊcouldnÕt point to a single example. Critical race theory is a body of academic work that originated in law schools in the 1970s and 1980s. Conservatives in the 2020s have started calling all discussion of racism Òcritical race theory,Ó but itÕs not clear how they found it in elementary school math textbooks. Republicans and the religious right have turned schools into the latest front in the culture wars. From laws that ban transgender children from playing school sports to restrictions on history class instruction on slavery and the Holocaust, conservatives have pushed dangerous claims using racist and homophobic stereotypes and slurs. The legislature also passed the ÒDonÕt Say GayÓ law that prohibits teachers from discussing gender identity or sexual orientation in certain grades. Stevens, an atheist, is turning the tables on Bible-beating conservatives who touted the law. Listing multiple examples of Òprohibited content,Ó Stevens backed up his assertions with chapter and verse. ÒWith the constant concerns about teaching Critical Race Theory, should we not take stock of the BibleÕs position on slavery? I am concerned our young white students will read such passages and wake up to civilizationÕs sordid past,Ó he wrote in his complaint. ÒI wish to file such an objection, requesting the Miami-Dade County Public School system immediately remove the Bible from the classroom, library, and any instructional material,Ó Stevens writes in his request. ÒAnd, as is often the case with banned books, I ask your agency lay flame to that giant stack of fiction in a pyre worthy of a Viking sendoff.Ó ÒIf theyÕre gonna ban books, then the whole library should be in play. My hope Ñ and itÕs a longshot Ñ is that they will apply their own standards to themselves and ban the Bible,Ó StevensÊtold theÊMiamiÊNew Times."

Wade. The latest: Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One that if the leaked document becomes the decision of the court, it will put into doubt other Supreme Court decisions that expanded the right to privacy. ""It would mean that every other decision related to the notion of privacy is thrown into question,"" Biden said, specifically referring to the decision in the 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut, which determined that the right to privacy prevents states from making the use of contraception by married couples illegal. ""If the rationale of the decision as released were to be sustained, a whole range of rights are in question. And the idea that we're letting the states make those decisions would be a fundamental shift in what we've done,"" he added. ""If this decision holds, it's really quite a radical decision,"" he said. The big picture: If the Supreme Court were to overturn its precedents, abortion access would no longer be federally protected and instead a patchwork of state laws would govern the procedure. Without Roe, abortion would immediately become illegal in at least 13 states. Even with precedents still in place, Republican-led states across the U.S. are already moving to pass and enact restrictive laws. What they're saying: ""If the Court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November,"" Biden said in a statement. ""We do not know whether this draft is genuine, or whether it reflects the final decision of the Court. With that critical caveat, I want to be clear on three points about the cases before the Supreme Court,"" he added. ""[M]y administration argued strongly before the Court in defense of Roe v. Wade ... I believe that a woman's right to choose is fundamental, Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned."" ""At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law."" Vice President Kamala Harris said at an event Tuesday evening that ""if the court overturns Roe v Wade, it will be a direct assault on freedom, on the fundamental rights of self-determination to which all Americans are entitled."" ""At its core, Roe recognizes the fundamental right to privacy … When the right to privacy is attacked, anyone in our country may face a future where the government can interfere with personal decisions. Not just women, anyone.” ""We are not going back,"" she added. ""Let us fight for our country and for the principles upon which it was founded, and let us fight with everything we have got."" Barack and Michelle Obama issued their own statement Tuesday afternoon, saying the draft decision ""simply forces folks to give up any constitutionally recognized interest in what happens to their body once they get pregnant."" ""The consequences of this decision would be a blow not just to women, but to all of us who believe that in a free society, there are limits to how much the government can encroach on our personal lives,"" the statement added. Worth noting: This is one of the few times that an official White House statement on abortion contains the word ""abortion."" State of play: The House in September passed the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill that would codify the right to an abortion under federal law. However, the legislation died in the Senate, where it did not have the necessary 60 votes. Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) first introduced the bill in Congress in 2013, and has continued to do so ever since. September marked the first time that WHPA passed a chamber of Congress. What we're watching: A trio of abortion rights groups — Planned Parenthood Action Fund, NARAL Pro-Choice America and EMILY's List — on Monday announced that they plan to spend $150 million on the upcoming 2022 midterms ""to ensure the election of reproductive freedom champions."" Their efforts will focus on electing officials ""up and down the ballot, from state legislatures, to [attorneys general] and governors, to U.S. congressional races,"" the groups said. The organization said they will focus on states such as Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, California, Kansas and Wisconsin."

Wade falls, minister says","American women will be able to obtain abortions in Canada if the United States Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade and returns abortion law to the state level, says Karina Gould, minister of families, children and social development. In an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics on Tuesday, Gould was asked if American women would be allowed to access the procedure in Canada. ""I don't see why we would not,"" she told host Vassy Kapelos. ""If they, people, come here and need access, certainly, you know, that's a service that would be provided."" Gould's remarks came after U.S. political news outlet Politico published a copy of an initial draft opinion written by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, a Republican appointee. That opinion suggests a majority of justices are prepared to overrule Roe v. Wade — the landmark decision that allowed legal abortions in the U.S. — and return the issue to state legislatures. The opinion claims the 1973 Roe decision was constitutionally dubious and ""egregiously wrong from the start"" because its reasoning was ""exceptionally weak."" The opinion argues that decades-old decision — which essentially found that the right to privacy extends to reproductive choices like an abortion — has had ""damaging consequences"" by dividing the nation into anti-abortion and pro-choice factions and robbing state officials of the power to regulate the practice. Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter to reaffirm his support for women's reproductive rights without specifically mentioning the leak from the U.S. Supreme Court. ""The right to choose is a woman's right and a woman's right alone,"" he said. ""Every woman in Canada has a right to a safe and legal abortion. We'll never back down from protecting and promoting women's rights in Canada and around the world."" Coming to Canada In recent years, numerous Republican-led states have passed abortion restrictions and so-called ""trigger laws"" which would kick in and automatically ban abortions if the Supreme Court provides the legal foundation. If Roe is overturned, abortion is likely to remain legal in liberal states. More than a dozen states have laws protecting abortion rights. California has said it would look for more ways to accommodate out-of-state individuals seeking abortions if the law is overturned. Judy Chu, a Democrat U.S. representative from California, also told CBC News Network's Power & Politics Tuesday that her state already is seeing women crossing the border from Texas seeking abortions, a practice she said will only increase if Roe vs. Wade is overturned. ""There is a definite uptick already. Can you imagine if 26 states were banning abortion because of Roe v. Wade falling?"" she said. ""Yes, there [would] definitely be women coming to Canada, Mexico and to the other states which are upholding abortion."" Gould said that while Canada will remain open to American women seeking abortions, she also has concerns about what overturning Roe v. Wade could mean for Canadian women seeking abortions. ""One of the concerning factors here is that there are many Canadian women who maybe don't live near a major city in Canada, but will often access these services in the United States,"" she said. ""I'm very concerned about the leak yesterday. I'm very concerned about what this means, particularly for American women, but also for Canadian women."" A spokesperson for Gould told CBC News women can obtain abortions in Canada now, at a cost. ""Americans accessing health care services in Canada would continue to have to pay for the service out-of-pocket or by their own private insurance if they are not covered by a provincial health insurance, by the Interim Federal Health Program or Non-Insured Health Benefits."" The issue of abortion has been the subject of much political debate in Canada — perhaps nowhere more so than within the Conservative Party. Former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney failed to pass legislation on abortion after the Supreme Court's 1988 R. v. Morgentaler decision invalidated past Canadian law on the practice. As it stands, there is no federal law governing access to abortion. In this context, the Conservative Party's previous leaders, including former prime minister Stephen Harper and MPs Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole, have been dogged by questions from the press and the public about their position on legislating abortion access — and successive Liberal and NDP leaders have made Conservative ambiguity on the topic an election issue."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York says student-loan forgiveness is good for everyone — even those who have already paid off their debt. ""Maybe student loan forgiveness doesn't impact you,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an Instagram story, in response to a question on the benefits of debt cancellation for those who already paid off their loans. ""That doesn't make it bad. I am sure there are certainly other things that student loan borrowers' taxes pay for. We can do good things and reject the scarcity mindset that says doing something good for someone else comes at the cost of something for ourselves."" ""It all comes around,"" she added. ""It's okay. We can support things we won't directly benefit from."" The student-loan-forgiveness conversation is picking up steam after President Joe Biden told reporters last week that he and lawmakers will come to a decision on relief ""in the next couple of weeks."" While he said he is not considering canceling $50,000 in student debt for every federal borrower — an amount many progressives have been pushing for — a number of reports have suggested the president is considering at least $10,000 in relief that will likely be tied to income limits, and it will be implemented before the pause on payments expires after August 31. While many Democrats would like to see broad loan-forgiveness legislation, Ocasio-Cortez told The Washington Post she has concerns with subjecting the relief to income thresholds. ""I don't believe in a cutoff, especially for so many of the front-line workers who are drowning in debt and would likely be excluded from relief,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Canceling $50,000 in debt is where you really make a dent in inequality and the racial wealth gap. $10,000 isn't."" Republican lawmakers feel differently. Since the news came out that the president is considering canceling some amount of student debt this summer, many of them slammed the possibility of broad relief. Sen. Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, for example, wrote about the cost forgiving debt would have on taxpayers on Twitter: ""Why should those who didn't go to college or responsibly paid their loans be responsible for $13,000 in new debt?"" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said broad relief would be a ""bribe"" to voters — an attempt by Democrats to win the midterm elections. Maine Sen. Susan Collins previously told Insider student-loan forgiveness is ""not fair"" to those who have already repaid their debt and argued people with higher incomes shouldn't qualify for the broad relief Biden is considering. But most Democrats want to see Biden enact broad student-loan relief for everyone, free of thresholds. ""Instead of continuously extending the pause under pressure he needs to cancel all student loan debt,"" Rep. Jamaal Bowman, of New York, recently tweeted."

/r/politics/comments/uieslq/gorsuch_kavanaugh_barrett_lied_to_the_us_senate/,1651693398,https://truthout.org/articles/gorsuch-kavanaugh-barrett-lied-to-the-u-s-senate-about-respecting-roe/,64295,"Gorsuch, Kavanaugh & Barrett “Lied to the US Senate” About Respecting “Roe”","Following the leak of a draft opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court indicating that the institution is set to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling making abortion legal throughout the U.S., more attention has been given to three specific justices who have likely endorsed that opinion — and what they said during their confirmation hearings just a few years ago. The draft order says it represents the majority opinion of the High Court. With all three liberal bloc justices likely to vote against it — and reports indicating conservative Chief Justice John Roberts was also unlikely to support completely dismantling the established precedent — the remaining five conservative bloc members are the most likely to potentially upend Roe. Three of those conservative justices — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — were confirmed in the past five years, under former President Donald Trump. Amid criticism and examination of how detrimental such a ruling could become, renewed scrutiny has been given to those three justices in particular, as their appointments directly led to the possibility of Roe being officially overturned later this year. All three justices, as nominees at the time, gave answers indicating they would give deference to the nearly 50-year-old precedent protecting abortion rights. Their private conversations with lawmakers, too, are inconsistent with what appears to be their ruling on dismantling Roe. In 2017, Gorsuch was nominated by Trump, who had himself promised only to select anti-abortion nominees to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch sought to assure senators tasked with approving him that he would not take the issue of abortion lightly, telling them during his hearings that he would have “walked out the door” had the former president demanded he overturn Roe. In an exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) during those same hearings, Gorsuch was asked whether he agreed with specific findings from Roe, including the idea that, for the purposes of the 14th Amendment’s interpretations, a fetus is not a person. “Do you accept that?” Durbin asked. “That is the law of the land. I accept the law of the land, senator, yes,” Gorsuch responded. In 2018, Kavanaugh also described Roe in similar terms. In private discussions with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), she said that the nominee had told her that the case and others like it protecting abortion rights were “settled law.” Kavanaugh tweaked that language a little bit during his hearings, but what he did say seemed to match what Collins suggested: that he believed Roe was mostly settled precedent. “It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis,” Kavanaugh said. He added: The Supreme Court has recognized the right to abortion since the 1973 Roe v. Wade case. It has reaffirmed it many times. And while Barrett tried to avoid calling Roe a super-precedent — a type of precedent that is seen as untouchable, in terms of how much harm it could cause if reversed — she herself acknowledged that her opinion on its status “doesn’t mean that Roe should be overruled.” Taken together, these statements imply that the three justices, when they were nominees being considered by the Senate to serve on the nation’s highest court, would take a cautious approach to changing Roe’s abortion protections, if they took any action on the matter at all. Instead, all three appear to have eagerly signed on to a draft order (authored by Justice Samuel Alito, another anti-abortion member of the conservative bloc) to undo the decades of precedent at the very first opportunity that presented itself. Several lawmakers have spoken out against the draft order, stating that, if it indeed becomes the opinion of the Supreme Court when it comes to abortion rights, it was done so erroneously and without consideration of precedent, as those justices had promised. Collins herself has expressed disappointment in confirming Kavanaugh specifically, noting that her private conversations with him did not indicate he’d upend Roe. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,” Collins said in a statement this week. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) blasted the draft opinion as wrongly decided. They also described the conservative justices who comprised the majority in the decision as liars. “Several of these conservative Justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the U.S. Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court’s reputation,” Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement."

Elizabeth Warren continued her push to ban members of Congress from trading or owning stocks during an interview released Tuesday, saying that the proposal would ""clean up the filth on the floor."" In an appearance Tuesday on the liberal podcast Pod Save America, the Massachusetts Democrat said the reform was necessary ""to start sweeping out the stables around Congress."" Warren is among the most vocal members of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who want to ban all members of Congress from trading stocks. Proponents of the reform argue that it is a conflict of interest for people who have the power to regulate companies and influence the market to benefit from trading stocks. The push to ban lawmakers from owning or trading stocks began late last year after Insider published ""Conflicted Congress,"" an extensive investigation into the financial holdings of lawmakers and their top staffers. Warren introduced a bill in February alongside Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana in February that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning and trading stocks, bonds, commodities, futures, and other securities. It's one of several stock-ban proposals now pending in Congress. ""If you want to be in the stock market, you can be in mutual funds, in index funds, but that's it,"" Warren said of her bill. ""This is public service."" Warren went further, telling the hosts that federal judges, the governors of the Federal Reserve, and ""everybody who heads up a cabinet agency or of any of our independent agencies"" should also face restrictions. Insider's ""Conflicted Congress"" investigation uncovered that nearly 60 members of Congress and more than 180 senior congressional staffers have failed to promptly disclose their stock trades in compliance with federal law. The project also documented several instances in which members of Congress were serving on committees overseeing certain industries even as they were personally invested in those industries. Insider's review of Congress' financial disclosure forms found that Warren does not buy or sell individual stocks in companies. She and her staff did not have any violations of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act, which prohibits members from using nonpublic information that they are privy to as lawmakers for personal benefit, and imposed financial reporting requirements for elected officials and their staff. The law is primarily designed to prevent insider trading and financial conflicts of interest and provide timely insight into lawmakers' personal financial trades. Heated stock debate in Congress Dozens of lawmakers share Warren's zeal for an ethical spring cleaning, though just how thorough a scrubbing they'll collectively tolerate remains to be seen. The stock-ban related bills leading the discussion today include the bicameral Ban Conflicted Trading Act, the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act, and the buzzy Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act. These, and other bills, take myriad approaches to curbing congressional stock trades by outlining who can participate (spouses; dependent children), how far to extend new guardrails (including to the Supreme Court or state legislatures), acceptable alternatives (blind trusts; exchange-traded funds), and bolstering enforcement tools (forfeiting all profits; losing one's salary). The Committee on House Administration conducted a hearing April 7 on the various proposals, but the hours-long affair produced more questions than answers, with some lawmakers raising concerns about how far any law might go. The scope of any potential compromise remains unclear as supporters keeping pushing for some sort of change before time — and, more likely, political will — runs out this midterm election year. The STOCK Act was inked into law 10 years ago, marking a decade where attitudes about the importance of financial transparency on Capitol Hill have fluctuated more than the investing habits of elected officials. ""The bottom line is we ought to do this,"" Warren told Pod Save America."

""In Texas, Republicans passed a law allowing rapists to sue their victims for getting an abortion,"" Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) responded incredulously. ""Can anyone name a 'far-left' policy that extreme implemented anywhere? We can't even get our party to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada."" Musk's Friday comments came less than 24 hours after he shared an image arguing that a ""conservative"" occupies the same ideological territory today as in 2008 while a ""liberal"" has moved increasingly leftward and become a ""woke 'progressive'"" unrecognizable to a centrist who once had more in common with the left but is now closer to the right. Musk's argument about a supposed leftward shift couldn't be further from reality, according to critics. Setting aside the fact that the Democratic Party as a whole has moved toward former President Ronald Reagan on many economic, carceral, and immigration policies since the late 1970s--resulting in more than four decades of bipartisan neoliberalism, which has only recently been challenged by a growing minority of progressive lawmakers--the Republican Party's rightward shift, which has been intensifying for decades, is completely ignored by Musk. Georgetown University professor Don Moynihan responded to Musk's post by sharing evidence from the Pew Research Center that shows how increasing political polarization in the U.S. Congress is being driven primarily by Republicans moving further and further right--not the other way around. According to Pew's March analysis of lawmakers' roll-call votes, ""Democrats and Republicans are farther apart ideologically today than at any time in the past 50 years."" While Democrats have become slightly more liberal on a two-dimensional spectrum, Republicans have become ""much more"" conservative. To take just one example of the GOP's creeping authoritarianism, Republican senators in 2006 voted unanimously to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Last November, only Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) joined Democrats in a failed bid to restore the landmark pro-democracy law. Fueled by former President Donald Trump's ""Big Lie"" that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, Republican lawmakers at the state level have embarked on a nationwide assault on the franchise, passing 34 voter suppression laws in 2021 and introducing dozens more this year. The GOP has also gone on an unprecedented censorship binge in recent months, banning books and threatening the job security of teachers across the nation. In addition, Republicans have been attacking abortion rights at a dangerous clip, as Ocasio-Cortez alluded to, as well as LGBTQ+ rights. Meanwhile, progressive lawmakers who are advocating for universal access to healthcare--during a pandemic that has killed nearly one million Americans--and an accelerated clean energy transition to secure a livable planet are being stymied at every turn by corporate lobbyists and lawmakers in both parties."

Wade. In a video posted to Twitter, protesters are seen standing in the rain outside a house with security detail in Chevy Chase, Maryland. ""My body, my choice,"" the protesters shout repeatedly. After demonstrating outside Kavanaugh's house, the group of about 100 protesters walked half a mile down to Chief Justice John Roberts' house, according to Bloomberg. It's unclear whether either Kavanaugh or Roberts was home at the time of the protests. On both sites, police ordered the protesters to leave the premises, Bloomberg reported. Protests erupted across the US after Politico published last week a leaked draft opinion in which Supreme Court Associate Justice Samuel Alito called the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortions nationwide ""egregiously wrong from the start."" Abortion will remain legal in the United States until the court hands down a final verdict, which could come as early as June, when the bench decides the verdict for another abortion case. If Roe is overturned, it will be illegal in 23 states to obtain an abortion, and there may be added restrictions in several others."
/r/politics/comments/uiuqjy/republicans_suddenly_dont_want_to_talk_about/,1651747680,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-roe-v-wade-supreme-court_n_62717566e4b0bc48f580af72?xtb,59605,Republicans Suddenly Don't Want To Talk About Banning Abortion,"WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans on Tuesday avoided answering questions about outlawing abortion in the wake of a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion suggesting Roe v. Wade’s days are numbered. Instead, Republicans focused on the unprecedented nature of the leak itself, calling for repercussions against the leaker and expressing concern about what such a breach of trust within the court would mean for legitimacy of the justices. When asked if he took pride for the apparent demise of Roe, which wouldn’t be possible without him, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) bristled at the suggestion. “That’s not the story for today,” McConnell insisted to reporters at a weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. Republicans have been working for decades to overturn Roe, an effort that culminated in the appointment of three Supreme Court justices by former President Donald Trump, who promised to nominate only justices who opposed abortion rights. One would think that Republicans would be openly celebrating their apparent victory before the court like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who was shedding tears of joy following the news on Monday. But GOP leaders pointedly refrained from doing so, something Democrats chalked up to the coming midterm elections. “They spent decades trying to repeal Roe and now they won’t even own up to it …Their spin masters are telling them to avoid the subject and they did,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday. “They’re like the dog that caught the bus ... They know they’ll pay consequences in the 2022 elections.” Polling has long suggested that most voters don’t favor overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court precedent that legalized abortion nationwide. Fifty-four percent of Americans think Roe should be upheld, while 28% believe it should be overturned, a 2-1 margin, according to a recent Washington Post/ABC poll. “They know that this is bad for them,” pollster Molly Murphy, president of Impact Research, said Tuesday at an EMILY’s List conference. “They know that this is not an issue they should be talking about.” Schumer said it is his intention to hold a vote on a bill that would enshrine abortion access in federal law, but Republicans are almost certain to block it. Democrats also lack the support within their caucus to eliminate the filibuster to pass it on their own. Republicans could retake the Senate in this fall’s midterm elections, giving them a chance to hold a vote on abortion legislation on their own. Anti-abortion advocates have pushed for a nationwide ban; already, 26 states are either likely or certain to outlaw abortion if Roe is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute. On Tuesday, HuffPost interviewed more than a dozen Republican senators. Most declined to comment on future abortion legislation, saying they were more focused on the impropriety of someone leaking a draft Supreme Court opinion. “I am going to focus right now on the leak,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said. “That’s what we’re talking about right now. Let’s let the Supreme Court go through their deliberations first, go through the proper process.” Ernst is planning to introduce legislation banning abortion nationwide, according to an anti-abortion activist interviewed by The Washington Post. Only Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he still supported an abortion ban, but lamented that such a proposal probably lacked enough support. “There’s not the votes for a federal abortion ban at this point, but I think every child is valuable and I think we will get there eventually,” Lankford said. In the draft opinion, which the Supreme Court has confirmed as authentic but said is not final, Associate Justice Samuel Alito wrote that it “is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives,” meaning state legislatures. Several Republicans agreed with Alito, saying that if the Supreme Court ultimately does overturn Roe, lawmakers in each state should decide whether abortion should be legal or illegal. “If the court makes the right decision and strikes down Roe, the result would not be that abortion would be illegal everywhere,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said. “In bright blue states like California and New York, at least in the short term, abortion almost surely would remain universally available. In redder states like my home state of Texas, we would see more significant restrictions.” Cruz has supported federal anti-abortion bills in the past, such as bans on “partial birth” abortion. He said voters can “vote in new representatives” if they disagree with state or federal laws. Thirteen states have “trigger” laws on the books that will immediately go into effect if Roe is overturned. Trigger laws have never actually been implemented so the legality and court challenges surrounding them are unclear. Most trigger laws have limited exceptions for rape and incest, while some only include exceptions if the pregnant person’s life is at risk. Several trigger laws, like in Tennessee and Kentucky, would make it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion. All trigger laws exempt people seeking abortion from being criminalized, at least for now. In a campaign messaging memo obtained by Axios on Tuesday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee advised Republicans to a compassionate consensus-builder on abortion policy. “Republicans DO NOT want to throw doctors and women in jail. Mothers should be held harmless under the law,” the document says. Most Republican senators co-sponsored a symbolic bill last year that would impose criminal penalties and prison time for doctors who fail to provide care for an “infant born alive after an abortion.” On Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the Supreme Court leaker should maybe be thrown in jail. “Everyone who had access to this document should be interviewed and asked if they leaked it,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. “And then the leaker is going to have to make a decision whether to tell the truth or lie to an FBI agent.”"

In petitions sent to public school superintendents across the state, Chaz Stevens asked the districts to ""immediately remove the Bible from the classroom, library, and any instructional material,"" Stevens wrote in the documents, which were shared with NPR. ""Additionally, I also seek the banishment of any book that references the Bible."" His petitions cited a bill signed into law last month by Gov. Ron DeSantis, which lets parents object to educational materials. That bill came about after some parents complained about sexually explicit books being taught in Florida schools. Many of those books, such as Gender Queer: A Memoir, deal with LGBTQ themes and coming out stories. DeSantis celebrated the removal of Gender Queer at a news conference after the signing of the law. It's ""a cartoon-style book with graphic images of children performing sexual acts,"" he said last month. ""That is wrong."" Liberals have been critical of the legislation. After passage, the state's Democratic leader, Lauren Book, lamented Florida's joining ""places like Russia and China, modern-day examples of what happens when free thought and free speech are tightly restricted in all levels of society, including in school."" So, with Florida the latest flashpoint in the culture wars, Stevens decided it was time to take up arms. His target: The Bible. ""My objection to the Bible being in your public schools is based on the following seven points, offered for your learned consideration,"" Stevens wrote. Stevens proceeded to question whether the Bible is age-appropriate, pointing to its ""casual"" references to murder, adultery, sexual immorality, and fornication. ""Do we really want to teach our youth about drunken orgies?"" He also took issue with the many Biblical references to rape, bestiality, cannibalism and infanticide. ""In the end, if Jimmy and Susie are curious about any of the above, they can do what everyone else does – get a room at the Motel Six and grab the Gideons,"" he wrote. The 57-year-old Deerfield Beach man says his ire was stoked after Florida lawmakers decided this month to ban 54 math books that were claimed to have incorporated topics such as critical race theory. ""I love the algebras,"" says Stevens, who studied applied mathematics in college. ""And those Tally [Tallahassee] loons just banned a bunch of arithmetic books?"" Stevens sent the petitions as a way to point out the hypocrisy, he said. ""If you want to teach morality and ethics, do you really want to turn to a book that wants you to dash babies against rocks?"" he told NPR, pointing to Psalm 137:9. Stevens, who doesn't have any children attending Florida public schools, says he hasn't heard back from any of the school districts yet. But his group is tracking when the emailed petitions are opened. As of late Monday, the Pasco County School District had shared the email internally 35 times, he said — and Duval County reached out to the state capital for guidance. ""My activism in the past has been wildly successful,"" Stevens said. ""And, I imagine, will continue on a similar trajectory."" Stevens said he is particularly interested in drawing attention to the hypocrisy. ""I don't have the votes,"" he said. ""My job is merely to turn hypocrisy on itself and let the bureaucrats eat eachother for lunch."" It's not the first time Stevens has made waves for his activism. In 2015, he petitioned 11 South Florida municipalities to either drop the prayer that opens their city commission meetings, or let him lead a prayer in the name of Satan. After Stevens' requests, some Florida cities ended up dropping their moment of prayer altogether. ""The satanic stare withered them down,"" Stevens told the Sun Sentinel."

Robert ""RJ"" Regan has lost his bid to represent Michigan's 74th district, according to unofficial results reported by The Detroit Free Press on Tuesday night and with all precincts reporting. Democrat Carol Glanville had defeated Regan in the special election by more than 1,500 votes based on results as of 10.30 p.m. ET, winning 51 percent of the vote to Regan's 40 percent, while 7.9 percent support went to write-in candidates. ""West Michigan values of integrity, decency, and care for the common good won tonight,"" Glanville tweeted in response to her apparent victory. ""The people of the 74th District have spoken, and I hear you. We are united in fundamental ways, and I will take our values and concerns to the Capitol to affect positive change. Thank you!"" Regan had been considered the leading contender to win the race as the 74th district has traditionally been deep red and has never been represented by anyone other than a Republican. In March, Regan earned criticism from Democrats and Republicans over comments he made about rape during a virtual panel. He was speaking during a section of the panel about whether Republicans should continue to argue that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. No evidence has been produced to support this claim. ""Having three daughters, and I tell my daughters, 'Well if rape is inevitable, you should just lie back and enjoy it so.' That's not how we roll, that's not how I won this election. We go right at it,"" Regan said. Regan had won the Republican primary on March 1 and a video of the panel where he made the comments was posted to video sharing site Rumble on March 6. Those comments earned bipartisan backlash, including from the Republican Regan was running to replace. State Senator Mark Huizenga, who vacated the 74th district to pursue a successful state Senate bid, condemned Regan's remarks. ""As a Christian, a public servant and a father of two daughters, I find Robert Regan's comments about sexual assault to be revolting and immoral, and I strongly denounce them,"" the senator said in a statement. Huizenga's statement also addressed Regan's history of sharing conspiratorial content online, including about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""His statements about Russia's unprovoked attack of a sovereign country are contrary to our own nation's values, and his anti-Semitic posts claiming Jewish people control the banks and were behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks are shameful and disgusting,"" Huizenga said. Regan also shared misogynistic content and suggested that COVID-19 vaccines are not effective. Michigan's 74th district will cease to exist on December 31 when new maps will take effect. Both Glanville and Regan have filed to run in the new 84th district."

The report, by North Dakota newspaper The Forum, alleged the 78-year-old Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages with a 34-year-old jailed landscaper, Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier, who faces federal child pornography and sexual abuse charges. In an email statement on Wednesday, Holmberg, a Republican, said he would be stepping down as chairman of Legislative Management, a committee that oversees the North Dakota Legislature's work between sessions. ""Recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion,"" Holmberg wrote in the statement to The Forum. ""Consequently, I will be stepping down as chairman of Legislative Management, effective immediately. This will allow Vice-chairman Chet Pollert to complete my term."" ""No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming."" Morgan-Derosier was being held on state child pornography charges at the Grand Forks County Jail in the summer of 2021. Inmates at the Grand Forks jail are allowed to use an approved text messaging service while detained. It is through this service that Morgan-Derosier allegedly contacted Holmberg. The Forum, quoting jail records, reported on April 15 that a phone number used by Holmberg was among those that Morgan-Derosier had texted on Aug. 23 and 24 last year when he was in jail. Holmberg told the news outlet that his text messages with Morgan-Derosier were related to ""a variety of things,"" including patio work Morgan-Derosier did for him. He said he no longer had the text messages. The subject of Morgan-Derosier's texts had come up earlier at a Jan. 4 detention hearing in North Dakota's federal court, when Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Puhl said Morgan-Derosier texted a ""77-year-old man from Grand Forks"" on August 23, 2021. The 77-year-old man, who was not identified in court, told Morgan-Derosier that ""he wants him to bring (Morgan-Derosier's boyfriend) over to his house to give him a massage,"" Puhl said in a transcript obtained by The Forum. The boyfriend was 19 or 20 years old. ""At the time of the defendant's arrest, law enforcement asked (the boyfriend) whether he was aware that the defendant was serving him up to a 77-year-old man, and (the boyfriend) said no,"" Puhl said, according to the transcript. Holmberg, when asked by The Forum about the messages mentioned in court, said ""I don't know what you're talking about."" GOP state Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner reflected on the incident while speaking to the Associated Press. He said that Holmberg is guilty of bad judgment but nothing else, at this stage. ""He sent 72 messages to a bad, bad person,"" Wardner told the AP. ""That's not illegal and until there is more information I think [his committee resignation] is a step in the right direction... If there is any evidence of any wrongdoing, we will act and we will act quickly. Right now, all we have is that it looks bad."" Holmberg was first elected to the North Dakota Senate in 1976 and has been the nation's longest-serving state senator. As well as being the chairman of the state Senate Appropriations Committee and procedural Rules Committee, he also serves on the interim Budget Section. Earlier this year in March, Holmberg announced his decision to retire as a state senator this year, according to The Forum. He cited medical issues that deprived him of the ""cognitive ability to accurately perform"" his work as one of the reasons. When Holmberg was contacted for additional comment he told Newsweek: ""Under advisement of counsel I will make no further comments."""

Susan Collins of Maine, one of just two nominally pro-choice Republicans in the Senate, called the police on Saturday night over an abortion-rights message written in chalk in front of her house in Bangor. According to the Bangor Daily News, officers responded to a call at 9:20 p.m. on Saturday after the message appeared on a public sidewalk on West Broadway. It read: ""Susie, please, Mainers want WHPA —> vote yes, clean up your mess."" ""WHPA"" is a reference to the Women's Health Protection Act, a bill that would codify the right to an abortion, afforded by Roe v. Wade, into federal law. Senate Democrats teed up a Wednesday vote on the bill, which was passed by the House in September, in the wake of a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe. ""The message was not overtly threatening,"" Wade Betters, a spokesperson for the Bangor Police Department, told the Bangor Daily News, which also reported that the message was no longer visible by Monday afternoon. ""We are grateful to the Bangor police officers and the city public works employee who responded to the defacement of public property in front of our home,"" the senator told the Bangor Daily News. ""Because Senator Collins periodically gets threatening letters and phone calls, we have been advised by Capitol Police to notify the local police department when there is activity directed at her around her home,"" her office said in a statement to Insider. Collins, who describes herself as a proponent of abortion rights, opposes the Women's Health Protection Act, saying the bill goes too far because medical providers who object to abortion for moral or religious reasons wouldn't be allowed to refuse to perform the procedure. She's said she'll vote no on the legislation, which is expected to fail in the Senate without the support of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who's also stated his opposition to it. Collins voted to confirm Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, three of the five conservative justices who Politico reported voted in favor of the draft opinion, which would overturn decades of precedent on abortion rights. ""I could not vote for a judge who had demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade because it would indicate a lack of respect for precedent,"" she told CBS in 2018, adding that Kavanaugh told her he ""views precedent not just as a legal doctrine but as rooted in our Constitution."" Collins criticized Gorsuch and Kavanaugh's support for revoking the right to an abortion following the publication of the draft opinion by Politico last week. ""If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,"" Collins said in a statement. Collins and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who also opposes overturning Roe, have put forward a more moderate bill, called the Reproductive Choice Act, but pro-choice groups and Democrats have panned the legislation."

Speaking to former Fox News host Lou Dobbs' podcast on April 9, Greene listed other reasons why people should not join the military, including the vaccine mandate and ""woke"" training. Greene made the remarks after Dobbs questioned the ""quality of people"" that are in the Defense Department in Biden's administration and suggested that the military was struggling to attract new recruits because people have ""seen the way they're treated."" The military has said that it has been struggling to recruit in the wake of the COVID pandemic, with the U.S. Army reporting it didn't meet its goal for new members in late 2021. In January, the Army offered $50,000 bonuses to those who can commit to six years of service in order to help the dwindling numbers. During the interview, Dobbs questioned why people should join the U.S. military if they will be enlisted as ""boots on the ground"" to fight wars abroad, with around 100,000 American service members currently deployed across Europe amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Dobbs also suggested people will be turned off from enlisting in the wake of Biden's withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last August. ""Can you imagine explaining to a recruit, you're gonna be just fine, just like those Marines in Kabul,"" Dobbs said in reference to the 13 service members who were killed in Afghanistan's capital airport in August 2021 while the U.S. was withdrawing from the country prior to the Taliban takeover. ""We may not have time to come back and get you. But you know, it'll work out all right [...] We're going to fight a third world country for two decades and walk out with our tail between our legs,"" Dobbs added. ""Who in his or her right mind would say 'sign me up for that, Sarge?'"" In response, Greene said: ""Not my son and I know a lot of young people don't want to have anything to do with that. It's like throwing your life away. ""Not to mention how they've been forced to take the vaccine and the ones that didn't want to take it have been discharged. Who wants to be treated that way?"" Greene also suggested that rules of engagement mean that people are ""shot at, killed and maimed"" before they're allowed to fire back and defend themselves. ""It's a disaster from the top down and the bottom up. We can add in the training, the woke training, where they have to undergo this ridiculous ideology of the sick and satanic left."" Greene appeared to be making reference to a letter sent to Army General Mark Milley by GOP Sen. James Inhofe, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 11 other Republican senators, which expressed concerns that service members were spending millions of hours getting training on extremism ""stand-down,"" climate change plans and ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion."" Greene also appeared to be echoing the rhetoric of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement while describing the left as ""satanic."" QAnon, a far-right movement which Greene previously expressed support for, believed that Donald Trump was secretly fighting a cabal of satanic child abusers, which included leading Democratic figures, during his time as president. Greene was recently accused of trying to rile up the QAnon base by describing GOP senators Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins as being ""pro pedophile"" because of their support for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be confirmed to the Supreme Court. The comments, which Greene was heavily criticized for, were based on disputed claims that Jackson was too lenient when sentencing child sex offenders. In a statement to Newsweek, Greene's spokesman, Nick Dyer, said the congresswoman was ""calling it like she sees it."""
/r/politics/comments/u6dc3n/time_to_tax_excessive_corporate_profits_we_did/,1650288964,https://prospect.org/economy/time-to-tax-excessive-corporate-profits/,55016,Time to Tax Excessive Corporate Profits,"Sen. Bernie Sanders recently introduced the Ending Corporate Greed Act. The act would impose a 95 percent tax rate on the excess profits of large corporations that earn more than $500 million a year. Excess profits are defined as profits that exceed the corporation’s average profit level from 2015 to 2019, adjusted for inflation. This excess profits tax will be imposed over and above the normal corporate tax of 21 percent, but the two rates will be coordinated so that the maximum combined tax rate will not exceed 75 percent of income for any year. The tax will be a temporary emergency measure, applying only in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Like many of Sen. Sanders’s ideas, this sounds radical (95 percent taxation!), but in fact it is not. The Sanders proposal is entirely in line with both the tradition of U.S. corporate taxation and with its underlying economic and regulatory rationales. More from Reuven Avi-Yonah First, the history: During the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War, the United States implemented a broad-based windfall profits tax. During World War II, the tax rate reached as high as 95 percent, which ensured that companies could not profiteer off the war. In addition, the United States enacted a windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies as recently as the mid-1980s. The idea underlying these prior efforts was that companies should not earn “windfall” profits, namely profits that result from external circumstances such as wars or extraordinary rises in the price of certain commodities, and not from their own efforts. The current combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised the profits of companies like Amazon to record levels, and the war in Ukraine, which did the same to oil and gas companies, fully justifies reviving the windfall profits tax. The Sanders proposal is essentially identical with the Word War II version of the tax, including the reliance on a pre-war average, the 95 percent rate, and the limitation on the overall effective tax rate. Second, the economics: Economists distinguish between normal returns to capital, which are subject to competition and therefore are relatively constrained, and rents or excess returns, which are not. Normal returns are a legitimate target of taxation, but the tax rate should not be too high because a high rate would deter companies from socially useful investments. Excess returns, on the other hand, are those that are not subject to competition. They are the returns a company that enjoys quasi-monopoly status like Amazon or Google, or quasi-oligopoly status like ExxonMobil or Chevron, earns from their access to a unique resource and their domination of the market. Because excess returns are not subject to competition, taxing them at even very high rates will not deter investments because the remaining after-tax profit will still be a windfall. The Sanders proposal correctly distinguishes between normal profits taxed at the regular 21 percent rate and extraordinary profits taxed at 95 percent. Finally, the regulatory aim: The corporate tax is not primarily about revenue (it is less than 10 percent of total federal tax revenue) or redistribution (it is unclear who bears the burden of the normal corporate tax in competitive conditions, since some of it can be shifted to employees or to consumers, while a tax on excess profits falls entirely on shareholders). The corporate tax is primarily about regulating large corporations by giving them tax incentives (for example, green-energy credits) and disincentives (like the proposed tax penalties for investing in Russia). The Sanders proposal is designed to regulate corporations that take advantage of the current inflationary wave, the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine to increase their profits way above their previous average profit. Ideally, it would raise little revenue but induce a fall in prices, which would benefit everyone except corporate shareholders. But if such a price decrease does not happen, the tax would raise significant revenue (according to Sen. Sanders, an estimated $400 billion in one year from 30 of the largest corporate profiteers alone). These revenues could be used to subsidize working families that suffer the effects of rising prices, and to accelerate the shift to renewable energy so that the economy is less at the mercy of the oil companies, domestic and foreign."

The investigation is the latest in a series ProPublica started in June 2021 that looks at the tax records of the top 0.001% wealthiest Americans. This installment uses a trove of tax filings from 2013 to 2018 to dive into the wealth of the 400 richest Americans, all of whom earn more than $110m a year. It found that the wealthy benefit from lower tax rates on financial assets and deductions from charitable contributions to keep their taxes low. The difference in tax rates between the wealthiest Americans and the average worker comes down to two critical factors, according to the investigation: first, the wealthy have their income taxed at a lower rate because much of their wealth is accumulated through investments, like stocks; and second, the wealthy are able to use large charitable donations to get huge deductions. Instead of the standard paycheck that most American workers get, which includes deductions for social security and Medicare taxes, the wealthiest Americans get their income through financial assets, like stocks, that are generally taxed at a lower rate. The long-term capital gains rate has been 20% since 2013. Billionaires in tech pay the lowest tax rate, an average of 17% of their income, largely because their wealth comes from such investment income. Bill Gates, whose income from 2013 to 2018 was an average of $2.85bn a year, paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 18.4%. Lauren Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, earned an average of $1.57bn and paid an average tax rate of 14.8%. Ten of the top 15 earners on the list are billionaires who made their money in tech. In comparison, the average single worker earning $45,000 paid an average tax rate of 21%. A married couple with one child who earns $200,000 paid a rate of 26%. In 2018, the highest top rate on ordinary income, which excludes investments, was 37%, yet the average tax rate for the 400 wealthiest Americans was 22% from 2013 to 2018. Executives and founders of private equity companies, of which there are 43 on the list, can get taxed at a lower rate through a loophole that allows them to report fees from managing clients’ money as an investment income, which is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Along with getting taxed at a lower rate through having an investment income, the wealthiest Americans can also write off huge chunks of their income by deducting large charitable donations. Michael Bloomberg, who earned an average of $2.05bn a year from 2013 to 2018, had 66% of his income deducted, giving him one of the lowest tax rates of the group – 4.1%. ProPublica noted that when reached for comments, no one named in the story disputed figures reported in the investigation, and few provided responses. One spokesperson for Ken Griffin, chief executive of hedge fund company Citadel, whose federal tax rate was 29.2%, said that the IRS data “significantly understate[s]” what Griffin pays because the rate was lowered by charitable contributions and does not include local and state taxes. A spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg, whose federal tax rate was 13.7% said: “Mark has always paid the taxes he is required to pay”, while a spokesperson for Bloomberg similarly said that he “pays the minimum tax rate on all federal, state, local and international taxable income as prescribed by law”. The disparity between the sky-high incomes of the wealthiest Americans and their tax rates is something that has already caught the attention of lawmakers. Last month, Joe Biden proposed a new tax on households making more than $100m a year. The plan, called the “billionaire minimum income tax”, would impose a 20% minimum tax on an individual’s realized and unrealized income, which would cover investment income. “In 2021 alone, America’s more than 700 billionaires saw their wealth increase by $1tn, yet in a typical year, billionaires like these would pay just 8% of their total realized and unrealized income in taxes. A firefighter or teacher can pay double that tax rate,” the White House said in a statement detailing the plan. At the recent meeting of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group made up of individuals with high net worth who believe the wealthy should pay more taxes, a topic of conversation was the tidal shift over taxing the wealthy that seems to be happening. “No one was talking about the taxing the rich when we started,” said Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock. “We have seen a huge change. You have a president talking about taxing the rich, people are talking about wealth taxes – those weren’t even fringe ideas 10 years ago. I’m not saying it’s going to happen and pass into law but there are conversations at the highest levels.”"

Wade's abortion-rights protections,"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin told reporters on Wednesday that he'd vote against his party's bill seeking to codify federal abortion rights with the Supreme Court seeming poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The West Virginia lawmaker insisted that he supported a federal right to abortion, but he said the Democratic bill, called the Women's Health Protection Act, went too far. ""It's just disappointing that we're going to be voting on a piece of legislation which I would not vote for today,"" Manchin told reporters. ""But I would vote for Roe v. Wade codification if it was today."" Manchin tore into the proposal, saying it ""expands abortion."" He told reporters he had been ""pro-life all of my life"" but did believe in some exceptions to abortion bans. On Tuesday, Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, reversed his previous position and said he'd support the party's proposal. Casey, who has at times supported abortion restrictions, said the leak of a Supreme Court draft majority opinion that would roll back abortion protections had changed his mind. In February, Casey voted to allow debate on the bill but said he was opposed to the underlying legislation. ""In light of the leaked Supreme Court decision draft overturning Roe v. Wade, and subsequent reports that Republicans in the US House and Senate will introduce legislation to enact a nationwide six-week ban, the real question of the moment is: Do you support a categorical ban on abortion?"" Casey said in a statement. ""During my time in public office, I have never voted for — nor do I support — such a ban."" Just over a week ago, Politico published a draft majority opinion from Justice Samuel Alito that, if finalized, would overturn the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and its later upholding of some abortion rights in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992. The court confirmed the authenticity of the opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts has ordered an investigation into the extraordinary leak. Manchin's position is similar to those of Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who support abortion rights but have argued for more narrowly tailored legislation. Nearly all states have civil protections for medical providers who refuse to provide abortion-related care on religious grounds. Collins and Murkowski have raised concerns that these protections would be undermined by Democrats' proposal, which supersedes a federal religious rights law. The legislation would outlaw prohibitions on abortion prior to fetal viability, which is generally between 23 and 28 weeks. It would also require states to allow postviability abortion ""for the preservation of the life or health of the person who is pregnant."" The bill would strike down hundreds of state-level abortion restrictions, including pre-abortion counseling requirements or what the bill calls ""medically unnecessary in-person visits."" Debate over the definition of what is considered the ""health"" of a pregnant person has raged for years. Abortion-rights groups have long argued that such counseling is required only as a way to try to coerce a woman out of getting an abortion. At least 13 states require in-person counseling, per the Kaiser Family Foundation."
/r/politics/comments/u9gjiz/marjorie_taylor_greene_to_be_confronted_in_court/,1650639273,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-hearing-jan-6-b2063431.html,51750,Marjorie Taylor Greene forced to admit she called for Pelosi to get death penalty,"Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene was left scrambling to avoid committing perjury on Friday after an attorney representing voters seeking to disqualify her from this year’s election ballot confronted her with video of past statements in which she accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of “treason” and suggested the California Democrat should be executed. Speaking at an administrative hearing before a Georgia judge, attorney Ron Fein promised “direct evidence” that will show Ms Greene used “hashtags and memes and ways of communicating among internet subcultures” to express support for the worst attack on the Capitol since 1814, and said Ms Greene herself will be “the most powerful witness in establishing that she crossed the line into engagement of insurrection”. “You'll hear her words of course on the stand, what she says and what she doesn't say. You'll also hear what she said in the past ... some of that will be in somewhat coded or veiled language, but you'll also hear in some cases, the mask falls and she shows us exactly what she intended,” he said. And when it came time to question her, he delivered on that promise. After Ms Greene was sworn in as a witness, attorney Andrew Celli asked her if she had ever called Ms Pelosi a “traitor to our country”. The Georgia Republican replied immediately: “No, I haven’t said that”. After a moment, the attorney asked for an exhibit to be called up for viewing, at which point Ms Greene interjected: ""Oh no, wait, hold on now! I believe that by not securing the border that violates her oath of office”. The video, which was taken during a 2019 political rally in Washington, showed her doing exactly what she initially denied. In it, Ms Greene addresses a crowd regarding Ms Pelosi, who she said was “guilty of treason”. “She took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold our laws. And she gives aid and comfort to our enemies who illegally invade our land. That's what treason is,” she said. “And by our law, representatives and senators can be kicked out and no longer serve in our government — and it's a crime punishable by death”. Asked again if she had said those words, Ms Greene admitted that she had. The challenge to Ms Greene’s candidacy was brought on behalf of a group of Georgia voters by the non-profit group Free Speech for People, which describes itself as a “catalyzing leader in the country challenging big money in politics, confronting corruption in government, fighting for free and fair elections, and advancing a new jurisprudence grounded in the promises of political equality and democratic self-government”. The group has filed challenges against several pro-Trump members of Congress who were vocal in their support for Republican attempts to overturn the election which culminated in the 6 January insurrection. A prior legal challenge against North Carolina Representative Madison Cawthorn has stalled after a Trump-appointed federal judge ruled that the part of the 14th Amendment to the US constitution which states that “no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress ... who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof,” was essentially nullified by an amnesty law meant to lift the disqualification against persons who supported the pro-slavery confederacy during the American Civil War. But a Georgia federal judge allowed the challenge against Ms Greene to proceed last week, leading to Friday’s hearing. In his opening statement, Mr Fein argued that Ms Greene “played an important role” even if she didn’t lead or participate in the violent attack on the Capitol by encouraging the pro-Trump mob to see the events of 6 January as similar to those of 1776, the start of the US war of independence from Great Britain. “Instead of violence against a foreign empire, as we saw in 1776,” he said, Ms Greene “encouraged and helped facilitate violent resistance to our own government, our democracy and our Constitution”. “And in doing so, she engaged in exactly the type of conduct that triggers disqualification under under section three of the 14th Amendment, which is to say she engaged in insurrection,” he said."
/r/politics/comments/uekpka/republican_who_refuses_to_bend_the_knee_to_trump/,1651234893,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/29/trump-says-matt-dolan-is-not-fit-for-ohios-senate-seat-hes-gaining-ground-anyway-00028824,50397,Republican who refuses to bend the knee to Trump surges in Ohio Senate race,"The field of candidates chasing Ohio’s GOP Senate nomination has pledged allegiance to former President Donald Trump and beaten a path to Mar-a-Lago. But not Matt Dolan. The state senator has declined to kiss the ring, and instead run as a traditional conservative — pouring $10.6 million of his own money into the effort. Now, after languishing at the bottom of the polls since joining the Republican field, Dolan is finding that his strategy is finally showing signs of paying off. Days before the May 3 primary, Dolan appears to be experiencing a late burst of momentum. While J.D. Vance — who received Trump’s endorsement last week — has surged into first place according to the most recent Fox News poll, Dolan was the only other top contender to gain ground in the poll since last month. A separate poll released Tuesday by Blueprint Polling actually placed Dolan in first place with 18 percent of the vote, followed by Vance at 17 percent. Whatever momentum Dolan is riding, it was enough to prompt Trump to release a statement Tuesday suggesting that the state senator is “not fit” to serve in the Senate. “I think there’s mounting evidence that he’s in a scenario where he’s running up the middle, unmolested, with a unique message and some things in his favor,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who lives out of state but donated $250 to Dolan’s campaign in October. “Does it mean he has a lock on the race? No way. But it’s a competitive race, and he’s in it. He’s got the momentum, as of last week.” Dolan likely has a low ceiling of support, given his dependence on Republican voters who are willing to move on from Trump — a minority of the party. But in a splintered field of candidates, that could be enough. “When I made my decision to get into the race, I knew that it was going to be a tough slog, at least publicly, for a while,” Dolan said in an interview. “I knew that I would not be doing well in the polls until much, much later in the campaign. I think it’s playing out as I thought it was going to play out.” Internal Dolan polling shows him “tracking to second place,” according to a person familiar with the data who said the campaign has a “glide path to getting a plurality of the vote.” Widely viewed as a longshot, Dolan has avoided any real attacks from his opponents, who took turns going after one another for months in a cutthroat primary that has generated nearly $70 million in ad spending. The Club for Growth — a super PAC supporting former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, who has led in polls throughout most of the primary — took out ads targeting Vance, Jane Timken and Mike Gibbons as each saw gains in support in recent months. But they and other campaigns and outside interest groups never targeted Dolan, who has spent heavily on television ads with his own positive message since January. Dolan is the lone candidate who refuses to toe the Trump line. He has accused the former president of “perpetuat[ing] lies about the outcome” of the 2020 election. He called the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol a “failure of leadership” by Trump and an “attack on democracy.” At a March 21 debate, Dolan was the only candidate to raise his hand when the moderator asked who believed it was time for Trump to stop talking about the 2020 election. Yet Dolan has been careful to highlight that he considers himself a Trump supporter. Throughout the campaign, Dolan’s staff has been “dogged” about seeking corrections to any news reports that referred to Dolan as anti-Trump or a Never Trumper, according to a person working on the campaign. They would explain to reporters that Dolan had twice voted for Trump — unlike Vance — and that Dolan has said he would do so again if Trump were the nominee. Dolan has also said that he would not have voted to convict Trump in an impeachment trial. Though Dolan’s campaign was once dismissed as a vanity project, Trump has long paid attention to a possible rise by the candidate. On Tuesday, he attacked Dolan not as an opponent of his America First agenda, but because the Major League Baseball team Dolan and his family own, the Cleveland Guardians, changed its name from the Indians after the 2021 season. “Anybody who changes the name of the ‘storied’ Cleveland Indians (from 1916), an original baseball franchise, to the Cleveland Guardians, is not fit to serve in the United States Senate,” Trump wrote. “Such is the case for Matt Dolan, who I don’t know, have never met, and may be a very nice guy, but the team will always remain the Cleveland Indians to me!” A person close to Trump insisted there was no particular reason the former president released the Dolan statement Tuesday, and that it was unrelated to polling data circulating on Twitter that day placing Dolan in the lead or in second place. The person noted that the message was something Trump “has been saying for months” — at least since Dolan entered the race in September — and that Trump just wanted to “remind people” about the Dolans’ role in the team name change. Throughout the campaign, Dolan has said he was not part of the decision to change the name, but supports his family. While his campaign events this week haven’t drawn high-profile supporters — such as Trump, who held a rally Saturday to support Vance, or Donald Trump Jr., who has visited the state twice in recent days to stump with Vance — Dolan has earned endorsements from three newspaper editorial boards and dozens of municipal office holders around the state. Local surrogates have also engaged in an aggressive letters-to-the-editor campaign on his behalf. Mandel, meanwhile, has kept a low profile after traveling to campaign stops last week with Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser and a leading advocate for efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. This weekend, Mandel will appear at events with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Dolan’s campaign is well aware that Trump’s approval rating among Republican voters in the state is as high as 85 percent. Its approach has been to thread the needle between support for Trump’s agenda — Dolan joined other candidates in the primary in running an ad about closing the southern border — and his unapologetic denunciations of Trump’s baseless election fraud crusade. “What we sought to do from the outset was illustrate to folks that this race has to be about Ohio,” said Chris Maloney, Dolan’s campaign consultant. “You can be for pro-Trump policies and not share his personality, and that’s what is taking hold among Ohio Republicans.” In contrast with Dolan, whose large investment in the race for months appeared futile as he failed to gain significant traction, Gibbons, a wealthy business owner, has taken a dive after peaking earlier this year and loaning his campaign more than $16 million. Murphy, the Republican strategist, noted several factors are helping Dolan now. In addition to emerging unscathed after the other candidates spent months hurling insults at each other, Dolan fits the mold of pragmatic conservatives whom Ohio Republicans have traditionally chosen for Senate, including retiring Sen. Rob Portman, former Sen. and Gov. George Voinovich and current Gov. Mike DeWine. “He’s not an alien species at all to the normal comfort zone of the Ohio Republican Party,” Murphy said. Dolan and Timken have had campaign staff out on foot for more than two months, allowing them to have an established ground campaign. But Timken has been dark on broadcast television and cable for weeks in several markets, and has been completely off broadcast statewide the past week, running only $15,000 worth of cable ads. A super PAC supporting her, Winning for Women, now has only a small number of cable spots running. Dolan’s campaign and the Club for Growth are leading in television ads right now, followed by the pro-Vance super PAC Protect Ohio Values, an outside expenditure group that has received $13.5 million in donations from billionaire tech executive Peter Thiel. At a recent debate, Dolan was asked whether he could win the Republican nomination without Trump’s support. “Of course I can win,” Dolan said, pivoting to his record in the Ohio Legislature. “The irony of this whole thing is I’m the only one who has implemented Republican Trump ideas.”"

Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan plotted with Trump to stop Biden from becoming president, House January 6 committee says","Republican lawmakers held calls with former President Donald Trump in December 2020 to plot ways to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to court records filed by the congressional committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. The committee filed deposition excerpts on Friday, which detail how Republican lawmakers, such as Reps. Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan, plotted with Trump to stop then-candidate Joe Biden from becoming president. Gaetz, Jordan, and other Republican lawmakers participated in calls and meetings with Trump and his aides after he lost the 2020 presidential election, according to testimony given to the committee by Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Hutchinson said in the deposition records that various Republican lawmakers, including Gaetz, Jordan, Reps. Scott Perry, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Louis Gohmert, either met in person or dialed into meetings discussing ways to usurp Biden's victory. ""They felt that [former Vice President Mike Pence] had the authority to — pardon me if my phrasing isn't correct on this, but — send votes back to the States or the electors back to the States,"" Hutchinson said. Other Republican lawmakers who are part of the House Freedom Caucus were also part of these meetings, Hutchinson said. Representatives for Gaetz, Jordan, Perry, Taylor Greene, and Gohmert did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. During these meetings, the Republican lawmakers explored avenues that ""could potentially be a constitutional and viable option to either stall certification of the election or to delay the inauguration or to assert that Mr. Trump had actually won,"" she said. After the results of the 2020 presidential election came out, the Trump campaign has filed dozens of lawsuits alleging voter fraud, most of which have so far been denied, dismissed, or withdrawn. Independent election watchdog groups have said repeatedly that there was no widespread voter fraud. After the results came out, for example, The New York Times contacted election officials in every state, each of which said there is no evidence that fraud influenced the presidential election. But even after leaving office, Trump has continued to insist that the election was rigged. Republican lawmakers have echoed his unsubstantiated claims."

Wright didn’t seem able to understand how something like this could help young people and instead said that the point of the feature is to “keep parents in the dark.” Others on the right equated the Trevor Project with pedophilia, implying that an organization reaching out to LGBTQ teens in crisis is the same as a child sex abuser having sexually charged conversations with minors, as if any conversation involving LGBTQ identities is inherently pornographic. “Why is the Trevor Project encouraging children to keep secrets from their parents?” the far-right organization Moms for Liberty responded to Wright’s tweet. “Leftwing activists are predatory groomers,” conservative pundit Lauren Chen tweeted. “If you sit around designing and promoting ways to get in touch with kids so you can discuss sexuality and keep it from their parents, you are a groomer.” “They’re trying to break your children,” said conservative podcaster Jesse Kelly. The anti-LGBTQ account Libs of TikTok called the Trevor Project a “grooming organization” in a now-deleted tweet. James Lindsay, the professor who is best known for getting a fake academic paper published in 2017, claimed that it’s “only a matter of time until solid evidence of serious wrongdoing emerges regarding the Trevor Project.” He then said it’s the “Groomer Project posing as suicide prevention.” As many people pointed out, having an “escape” feature is fairly standard for crisis hotlines and web services since the people who turn to crisis hotlines often don’t have support from the people around them."

It’s not what any woman would choose for a happy time on Saturday night. But nobody likes women bleeding to death on the bathroom floor from illegal abortions either. What to do? Perhaps a different way of approaching the question would be to ask: What kind of country do you want to live in? One in which every individual is free to make decisions concerning his or her health and body, or one in which half the population is free and the other half is enslaved? Women who cannot make their own decisions about whether or not to have babies are enslaved because the state claims ownership of their bodies and the right to dictate the use to which their bodies must be put. The only similar circumstance for men is conscription into an army. In both cases there is risk to the individual’s life, but an army conscript is at least provided with food, clothing, and lodging. Even criminals in prisons have a right to those things. If the state is mandating enforced childbirth, why should it not pay for prenatal care, for the birth itself, for postnatal care, and – for babies who are not sold off to richer families – for the cost of bringing up the child? And if the state is very fond of babies, why not honour the women who have the most babies by respecting them and lifting them out of poverty? If women are providing a needed service to the state – albeit against their wills – surely they should be paid for their labour. If the goal is more babies, I am sure many women would oblige if properly recompensed. Otherwise, they are inclined to follow the natural law: placental mammals will abort in the face of resource scarcity. Demonstrators protest against the draft abortion ruling outside the US supreme court in Washington. Photograph: Allison Bailey/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock But I doubt that the state is willing to go so far as to provide the needed resources. Instead, it just wants to reinforce the usual cheap trick: force women to have babies, and then make them pay. And pay. And pay. As I said, slavery. If one chooses to have a baby, that is of course a different matter. The baby is a gift, given by life itself. But to be a gift a thing must be freely given and freely received. A gift can also be rejected. A gift that cannot be rejected is not a gift, but a symptom of tyranny. We say that women “give birth”. And mothers who have chosen to be mothers do give birth, and feel it as a gift. But if they have not chosen, birth is not a gift they give; it is an extortion from them against their wills. No one is forcing women to have abortions. No one either should force them to undergo childbirth. Enforce childbirth if you wish but at least call that enforcing by what it is. It is slavery: the claim to own and control another’s body, and to profit by that claim."

Hours before, Rep. Jim Jordan had been trying to achieve the same thing. Texting with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, a close ally and friend, at nearly midnight on Jan. 5, Jordan offered a legal rationale for what President Donald Trump was publicly demanding — that Vice President Mike Pence, in his ceremonial role presiding over the electoral count, somehow assert the authority to reject electors from Biden-won states. Pence “should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all,” Jordan wrote. “I have pushed for this,” Meadows replied. “Not sure it is going to happen.” The text exchange, in an April 22 court filing from the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 riot, is in a batch of startling evidence that shows the deep involvement of some House Republicans in Trump’s desperate attempt to stay in power. A review of the evidence finds new details about how, long before the attack on the Capitol unfolded, several GOP lawmakers were participating directly in Trump’s campaign to reverse the results of a free and fair election. It’s a connection that members of the House Jan. 6 committee are making explicit as they prepare to launch public hearings in June. The Republicans plotting with Trump and the rioters who attacked the Capitol were aligned in their goals, if not the mob’s violent tactics, creating a convergence that nearly upended the nation’s peaceful transfer of power. “It appears that a significant number of House members and a few senators had more than just a passing role in what went on,” Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the Jan. 6 committee, told The Associated Press last week. Since launching its investigation last summer, the Jan. 6 panel has been slowly gaining new details about what lawmakers said and did in the weeks before the insurrection. Members have asked three GOP lawmakers — Jordan of Ohio, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California — to testify voluntarily. All have refused. Other lawmakers could be called in the coming days. So far, the Jan. 6 committee has refrained from issuing subpoenas to lawmakers, fearing the repercussions of such an extraordinary step. But the lack of cooperation from lawmakers hasn’t prevented the panel from obtaining new information about their actions. The latest court document, submitted in response to a lawsuit from Meadows, contained excerpts from just a handful of the more than 930 interviews the Jan. 6 panel has conducted. It includes information on several high-level meetings nearly a dozen House Republicans attended where Trump’s allies flirted with ways to give him another term. Among the ideas: naming fake slates of electors in seven swing states, declaring martial law and seizing voting machines. The efforts started in the weeks after The Associated Press declared Biden president-elect. In early December 2020, several lawmakers attended a meeting in the White House counsel’s office where attorneys for the president advised them that a plan to put up an alternate slate of electors declaring Trump the winner was not “legally sound.” One lawmaker, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, pushed back on that position. So did GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Louie Gohmert of Texas, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a former special assistant in the Trump White House. Despite the warning from the counsel’s office, Trump’s allies moved forward. On Dec. 14, 2020, as rightly chosen Democratic electors in seven states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — met at their seat of state government to cast their votes, the fake electors gathered as well. They declared themselves the rightful electors and submitted false Electoral College certificates declaring Trump the true winner of the presidential election in their states. Those certificates from the “alternate electors” were then sent to Congress, where they were ignored. The majority of the lawmakers have since denied their involvement in these efforts. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia testified in a hearing in April that she does not recall conversations she had with the White House or the texts she sent to Meadows about Trump invoking martial law. Gohmert told AP he also does not recall being involved and that he is not sure he could be helpful to the committee’s investigation. Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia played down his actions, saying it is routine for members of the president’s party to be going in and out of the White House to speak about a number of topics. Hice is now running for secretary of state in Georgia, a position responsible for the state’s elections. Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona didn’t deny his public efforts to challenge the election results but called recent reports about his deep involvement untrue. In a statement Saturday, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona reiterated his “serious” concerns about the 2020 election. “Discussions about the Electoral Count Act were appropriate, necessary and warranted,” he added. Requests for comment from the other lawmakers were not immediately returned. Less than a week later after the early December meeting at the White House, another plan emerged. In a meeting with House Freedom Caucus members and Trump White House officials, the discussion turned to the decisive action they believed that Pence could take on Jan. 6. Those in attendance virtually and in-person, according to committee testimony, were Hice, Biggs, Gosar, Reps. Perry, Gaetz, Jordan, Gohmert, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Debbie Lesko of Arizona, and Greene, then a congresswoman-elect. “What was the conversation like?” the committee asked Hutchinson, who was a frequent presence in the meetings that took place in December 2020 and January 2021. “They felt that he had the authority to, pardon me if my phrasing isn’t correct on this, but — send votes back to the States or the electors back to the states,” Hutchinson said, referring to Pence. When asked if any of the lawmakers disagreed with the idea that the vice president had such authority, Hutchinson said there was no objection from any of the Republican lawmakers. In another meeting about Pence’s potential role, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis were joined again by Perry and Jordan as well as Greene and Lauren Boebert, a Republican who had also just been elected to the House from Colorado. Communication between lawmakers and the White House didn’t let up as Jan. 6 drew closer. The day after Christmas, Perry texted Meadows with a countdown. “11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration,” the text read. “We gotta get going!” Perry urged Meadows to call Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general who championed Trump’s efforts to challenge the election results. Perry has acknowledged introducing Clark to Trump. Clark clashed with Justice Department superiors over his plan to send a letter to Georgia and other battleground states questioning the election results and urging their state legislatures to investigate. It all culminated in a dramatic White House meeting at which Trump considered elevating Clark to attorney general, only to back down after top Justice Department officials made clear they would resign. Pressure from lawmakers and the White House on the Justice Department is among several areas of inquiry in the Jan. 6 investigation. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the panel from Maryland, has hinted there are more revelations to come. “As the mob smashed our windows, bloodied our police and stormed the Capitol, Trump and his accomplices plotted to destroy Biden’s majority in the electoral college and overthrow our constitutional order,” Raskin tweeted last week. When the results of the panel’s investigation come out, Raskin predicted, “America will see how the coup and insurrection converged.”"

That was a tax rate of 24.6% for 2021, well over the average of around 14% for all Americans. The totals were similar to the Bidens' 2020 returns, when they reported earning $607,336 as he ran for president. They reported a federal income tax rate of 25.9% then. The national median household income was $67,521 in 2020, according to U.S. Census data. It's the second straight year Biden has released his tax returns from the White House, reestablishing a tradition that presidents make their filings public after President Donald Trump declined to do so. Both this year and last were steep drops from 2019 for the Bidens, when they earned nearly $1 million, primarily from book sales, speeches and their teaching positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia Community College. Jill Biden still teaches in Virginia while serving as first lady. The returns show Biden earning $378,333 as president — his $400,000 annual salary minus the time before noon on Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2021 — and his wife receiving $67,116 for her teaching. The couple gave $17,394 to 10 different charities in 2021. The largest gift was $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, a nonprofit that works to combat child abuse named for their son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46. The Bidens also released their 2021 Delaware income tax return and reported paying $30,765 in state income tax there. The first lady released a Virginia return showing she paid $2,721 in Virginia state income tax. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, released their 2021 tax filings, which showed them earning $1,655,563 in 2021 and paying $523,371 — a federal income tax rate of 31.6%. Harris and Emhoff also paid $120,517 in California income tax and $2,044 in New York income tax. The second gentleman, who teaches at Georgetown Law School, paid $54,441 in District of Columbia income tax, and the couple contributed $22,100 to charity in 2021. Biden campaigned on the transparency of his personal finances, releasing 22 years of tax filings ahead of the 2020 election. It was a direct challenge to Trump, who argued for years that an audit prevented him from releasing his taxes — though the IRS had mandated for four-plus decades that the tax returns of sitting presidents and vice presidents be audited. The New York Times later obtained Trump's tax records and reported that he paid just $750 in federal income taxes during his first year in the White House. IRS figures indicate that the average tax filer paid roughly $12,200 in 2017, about 16 times what the former president paid. The returns were released on April 15, traditionally the deadline for paying federal taxes. This year the deadline has been extended to Monday, April 18."

Kirsten Gillibrand said Sunday that multiple Supreme Court justices lied in their confirmation hearings about abortion, echoing the statements of Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins in the wake of the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion. “If a corporation put these kind of statements in their quarterly filings, they would be seen to be purposefully misleading and deemed fraud,” Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I think they misled the Senate with the intention of getting their confirmation vote with the intention of overruling Roe.” Gillibrand was addressing last week’s leak of a draft opinion that showed the Supreme Court was prepared to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationally. “Four justices in the last hearings I’ve witnessed have said that precedent matters and that precedent is the foundation of our legal system,” she said. “And so if they just feel they can just upend this precedent because they don’t like it today, well, that’s inconsistent with what they promised.” Collins (R-Maine) last week said she felt betrayed by what she saw in the draft opinion. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice [Neal] Gorsuch and Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,” Collins said in a statement. Murkowski (R-Alaska) made a similar statement: “It was not the direction that I believed that the court would take, based on statements that have been made about Roe being settled and being precedent.” Overturning Roe v. Wade would take away women’s right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, Gillibrand emphasized — not men’s. She said she’d like to get rid of the Senate’s filibuster and “vote for our values.” When questioned whether ridding of the filibuster could in the future give Republicans the ability to make abortions illegal nationwide — something Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said is possible — Gillibrand said, “I don’t think the argument that Mitch McConnell will do bad things is persuasive at this point. [Those bad things] are already happening.” On “Fox News Sunday,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) flipped the notion about judicial nominees lying on its head, saying it was inappropriate for senators to push nominees on their views on specific cases before voting to confirm them. “You can’t bargain your way into getting onto the court,” he said. “So any senator who tries to bargain with a nominee — Will you uphold the case I like or overturn the ones I don’t? — is really doing a disservice to the court.”"

They are now coming for birth control,"As much as the National Republican Senatorial Committee would like Republicans to stay away from the abortion issue except to insist they are compassionate and caring about life, it isn't really working. That line is hardly a natural fit for a party that had a collective hysterical tantrum against Barack Obama's Affordable Health Care Act and proposes taxing the poor anyway. They are the ""Fuck Your Feelings"" party, after all, not the empathy and mercy crowd. There is little hope of eliding the consequences of their decades-long crusade to send women back to back-alley butchers. Nonetheless, they are haplessly trying to pretend that they are truly committed to helping all the people who will be forced to give birth against their will once the right to abortion is overturned. According to the National Women's Law Center, Mississippi has the highest poverty rate for women in the nation, one of the highest uninsurance rates for women in the nation and ranks last in the country for women's and children's health outcomes. If they revere life so much, why have they been punishing the poor women and children in their state who chose not to get abortions for the past 50 years? Mississippi's Gov. Tate Reeves wasn't the only Republican governor to make this disingenuous claim. So-called moderate Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas also said he thinks they should increase services for women who are in ""difficult circumstances"" with their pregnancies. Hutchinson signed that bill willingly and he's not the only one. In fact, as Stephanie Kirchgaessner of the Guardian reported last week, since 2019, when Republican House leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said that removing exemptions for rape and incest simply went too far, ""at least 11 US states – including Alabama, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas – have passed legislation that bans abortion without any such exceptions."" The idea has taken off like wildfire. According to the Guardian, this rapid change in attitude is attributed to the work of an anti-abortion group called Students for Life of America (SFLA), another astroturf production sponsored by big money GOP donors and co-chaired by Leonard Leo, the far right Federalist Society leader who shepherded Donald Trump's three arch-conservative, anti-abortion justices on to the Supreme Court. They seem to be very serious about their work and very good at getting it done. And as much as they insist that they aren't coming for contraception — they're coming for contraception. SFLA's executive director, Kristan Hawkins, has said that in her ideal world the pill and IUDs would be ""illegal."" She's certainly not the only conservative with those views although according to the official talking points they are supposed to lie about it and insist they have no intention of banning contraception. Here's Mississippi's Reeves again, clearly uncomfortable with the topic. Here's a somewhat chilling video with a very calm and almost robotic Idaho State Rep. Brent Crane, a Republican, discussing state interference in women's most intimate decisions and bodily functions as if he's talking about a bond issue for the local water district. He blandly admits that his caucus would certainly consider banning Plan B and IUDs. The good news is that he says the caucus isn't currently talking about prosecuting women for crossing state lines to obtain abortions or trying women who get abortions for murder — yet. And for those suggesting that any talk of criminalizing miscarriage is just more left wing hysteria, they would do well to inform themselves of the incidents that have already happened around the country. Mother Jones reported a horrific story about one Oklahoma woman who was convicted of manslaughter for having a miscarriage. In fact, there have been more than 70 cases of women being prosecuted for pregnancy related ""crimes"" in the state since 2007. If various ""personhood"" laws recognizing equal rights of the fetus are passed, you can expect to see more of this. They are talking about this stuff and more all over the country. Governors and statehouses are already passing draconian laws, testing novel new legal theories and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable even two years ago. Yet Republicans have been all over social media and cable news over the last week insisting that Democrats are being overwrought in their reaction, that they aren't going to see much change in the status quo and everyone just needs to calm down. But as you can see, the status quo is changing very, very quickly. Even before the leak we knew that anti-abortion activists and members of congress were working together on a nationwide ban on abortion. How that would work legally is anyone's guess, but let's just say these anti-abortion crusaders aren't going to rest on their laurels. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told USA Today that it's possible a national ban will be proposed but he insisted that there will be no carve out of the filibuster ""on any subject."" (That's a joke — he carved out the filibuster to put three ultra-orthodox wingnuts on the Supreme Court so his word isn't exactly gold on that subject. If McConnell thinks it will shore up his power he will do it without blinking an eye.) For right now he's having it both ways. As usual. Senate Majority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., will be putting up a show vote this week on the Women's Health Protection Act which would codify Roe v Wade. It has been passed by the House but was shot down in the Senate last February, 46-48 with six senators not voting. It is unlikely to pass this time and is subject to the filibuster anyway. Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin have already said they would not vote to lift the filibuster to pass it, so that's that. Schumer says this will illustrate for the American people where the Republicans stand. The thing is, everyone already knows where these Republicans stand on Roe. They haven't been keeping that a secret. But do we know where they stand on the prosecution of women for their pregnancy losses? On banning Plan B and IUDs? On exemptions for rape and incest? On spending the kind of money it would take to ensure that poor women and their children have the support some of them are promising? Where are the Republicans on religious exemptions such as those claimed by some Jewish organizations who say that banning abortion violates their first amendment rights? How about proposals such as the one by GOP Pennsylvania candidate for Governor Doug Mastriano, who would not only deny exemptions for rape and incest but also the health of the woman. Are they for that? If you want show votes to really expose what the right is proposing, then make these members of Congress vote on the specifics of what's at stake. If nothing else it will divide the Republicans, many of whom, even in the Senate, are anti-abortion fanatics who will vote for some of these things and it will tie the others up in knots. These aren't hypothetical ideas anymore. They are actually happening all over the country and as soon as Roe is overturned they will expand at a record pace. The problem is, the country doesn't know about it. The Democrats need to tell them and one way to do that is to have a big debate on all these fiendish proposals and phony promises in the House and Senate."

Where's the Democratic Party?"" the Democratic governor said to assembled press and abortion-rights supporters at a Planned Parenthood office in Los Angeles. In his speech, he called conservative advances in the culture wars a ""concerted, coordinated effort"" that the left is failing to counter effectively.

His speech echoed the protests that formed outside the Supreme Court soon after the leaked draft opinion was published on Monday, where people shouted: ""Democrats, do something!"" Politico reported. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke out soon after the leak, calling the draft opinion an ""abomination"" and one of the ""worst and most damaging decisions in modern history."" But efforts to codify Roe v. Wade into US law would likely be filibustered by Republicans, as Insider's Brent D. Griffiths reported. A nationwide constitutional amendment is also exceedingly rare in US history, as Insider's Dave Levinthal reported. In his Wednesday speech, Newsom had particular ire for the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, as well as Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who said on Tuesday that he would not end the filibuster in order to codify Roe v. Wade. Newsom has vowed to turn California into an abortion ""sanctuary,"" a promise he repeated after the leak by saying he would put forward a statewide constitutional amendment protecting reproductive rights. ""We'll be presenting that to the voters this November as an affirmative step to codify California's leadership,"" he said Wednesday. ""Pay attention, America. They're coming after you next,"" he said. ""That's not hyperbole. It is not hyperbole. Watch this space if privacy is not constitutionally protected, this opens up a panoply of issues.

(WFLA) — A Texas judge wrote a letter to Disney’s CEO inviting the company to move its Walt Disney World resort to the Lone Star State after its issues with Florida’s state government. Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill dissolving the Reedy Creek Improvement District, Disney’s private government that has been in place for 55 years. DeSantis signs bill to dissolve Disney’s private government This came after Disney openly opposed the Parental Rights in Education Bill, also known as the “Don’t Say Gay” Bill. Last March, the company announced it would end its political donations in Florida and instead support organizations in opposition to the law. In the midst of DeSantis’ feud with the Disney Company, Fort Bend County Judge JP George, the chief executive officer of Fort Bend County, Texas, wrote a letter inviting the company to relocate to his area and avoid “authoritarian, anti-business, and culture war attacks from extremists in Florida.” The letter, addressed to CEO Bob Chapek, promoted his county as an ideal location for the large amounts of purchasable land and its strategic location in the state of Texas. “In fact, major employers like Amazon, Texas Instruments, Comcast, Gallery Furniture, and others have recently made vast investments in our community including thousands of good paying jobs with many more employers on the way,” George wrote. In addition to inviting Disney to invest in Fort Bend County, the judge also invited Twitter to look into his home county as well."

Kyrsten Sinema ""an obstructionist"" and called for her to be primaried after the Arizona Senator said she wouldn't support changes to the Senate filibuster to pass a bill codifying abortion protections into federal law. ""We could protect Roe tomorrow, but Sinema refuses to act on the filibuster. Until that changes she can take a seat talking about 'women's access to health care,'"" Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted on Tuesday. ""Hold everyone contributing to this disaster accountable, GOP & Dem obstructionists included. She should be primaried."" Democrats are calling for Congress to codify abortion rights after Politico published a draft Supreme Court opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, in which the court's majority would uphold Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban and overturn the federal protections for first-trimester abortion restrictions enshrined in the Roe v. Wade decision. In September 2021, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed such a bill, the Women's Health Protection Act. But the chances of the legislation passing the evenly-divided US Senate are slim-to-none under the current filibuster rules, which require most legislation to earn a three-fifths majority of 60 votes to advance to a final vote. Sinema, a longstanding supporter of the filibuster rules, has long argued that the 60 vote threshold forces senators to work together and ""protects the country from wild swings in federal policy"" when partisan control of Congress changes hands. ""A woman's health care choices should be between her, her family, and her doctor,"" Sinema said in a Tuesday statement. ""Protections in the Senate safeguarding against the erosion of women's access to health care have been used half-a-dozen times in the past ten years, and are more important now than ever."" In February, the bill failed to advance in the Senate by a vote of 46-48, with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia joining all voting Republicans in blocking the measure. And both Manchin and Sinema both struck the final nail in the coffin of Senate Democrats' voting rights push in January by voting against a one-time change to the filibuster rules. Twice in 2015 and 2018, when Republicans controlled the Senate, two proposed bills that would have banned abortion after 20 weeks failed to attain the 60 votes necessary to move forward. In the 2018 vote, Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joined most Democrats in voting against advancing the 20-week ban bill. Sinema's stance against modifying or eliminating the filibuster has earned her the ire of progressives, spurred Democrats to openly discuss primarying her, and cost her support from pro-choice groups. In January, both EMILY's List and NARAL Pro-Choice America's political arm said they would no longer support Sinema for office after she voted against modifying the filibuster to pass the voting rights bill."
/r/politics/comments/ug4j09/disneys_special_district_tells_ron_desantis_to/,1651425299,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/ron-desantis-disney-reedy-creek-debt,47990,Disney’s Special District Tells Ron DeSantis to Cough Up $1 Billion or STFU,"Last week, like the petty tyrant he is, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill dissolving Walt Disney World’s special district status, as retribution for the company’s decision to speak out against his bigoted “Don’t Say Gay” law. Set to go into effect next June, the move abolishes Disney’s self-governing jurisdiction, the Reedy Creek Improvement District, and no longer allows it to effectively run its own city in and around the theme park. That means the counties of Orange and Osceola would be required to pay for services like firefighting, which Disney currently covers, and would be on the hook for Reedy Creek’s roughly $1 billion in outstanding bond debt. In other words, DeSantis’s act of revenge would not only punish a private company for condemning his anti-LGBTQ+ law, it would likely punish Florida residents too, whose property taxes would go through the roof. Which is a pretty wild thing for a governor to do, particularly one from a party that talks a big game about “cutting taxes” and “free speech.” But all of this might be moot anyway, because Disney apparently knows Florida’s laws better than DeSantis and has said that actually, he can’t do jack unless he pays off Reedy Creek’s debts first, and until then, it’ll be business as usual in Mouse Town. In a statement to its bondholders, reported by CNN, the Reedy Creek Improvement District pointed out that the 1967 state law establishing Disney’s special district states that Florida “will not in any way impair the rights or remedies of the holders…until all such bonds together with interest thereon, and all costs and expenses in connection with any act or proceeding by or on behalf of such holders, are fully met and discharged.” In other words, DeSantis’s attempt to dissolve the district is illegal unless he coughs up $1 billion first and because of that, Reedy Creek told bondholders, it’s not going anywhere. “In light of the State of Florida’s pledge to the District's bondholders, Reedy Creek expects to explore its options while continuing its present operations, including levying and collecting its ad valorem taxes and collecting its utility revenues, paying debt service on its ad valorem tax bonds and utility revenue bonds, complying with its bond covenants and operating and maintaining its properties,” the district wrote in the statement. Last week, amidst DeSantis’s petty act of retribution, Orange County tax collector Scott Randolph told The Washington Post, “Orange County is going to be stuck with $164 million or more per year in expenses with no revenue. So they’re going to have to raise property taxes. This is a huge tax increase on the citizens of Orange County that they’ll have to pay every single year.” Florida state representative Carlos Smith, also noted that, if dissolved, the hundreds of people who work for Reedy Creek—who are presumably Florida residents—will lose their jobs. Which is apparently fine with the governor, who reportedly has his sights set on the White House in 2024 and thinks operating like a dictator will appeal to the base, or at the very least, keep him in regular rotation on Fox News. “If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy,” DeSantis wrote in a fundraising email to supporters on Wednesday last week. “I will not allow a woke corporation based in California to run our state.” But apparently that “woke corporation” won’t be surrendering so easily!"

The Satanic Temple is hoping to raise one of its flags in front of Boston City Hall after the Supreme Court ruled Boston violated free speech rights when it refused to fly a Christian’s groups flag. “Religious Liberty is a bedrock principle in a democracy, and Religious Liberty is dependent upon government viewpoint neutrality,” Lucien Greaves, cofounder of The Satanic Temple said in a statement. “When public officials are allowed to preference certain religious viewpoints over others, we do not have Religious Liberty, we have theocracy.” Boston refused to let Camp Constitution, a New Hampshire-based Christian organization, hoist its flag in front of the third flag pole at City Hall Plaza as part of a ceremony in 2017, court documents stated. The commissioner of Boston’s Property Management Department said that flying a religious flag at City Hall could violate the city’s Establishment Clause — which prohibits a government from establishing an official religion. But Boston has allowed different flags in the past. Between 2005 and 2017, Boston approved the raising of around 50 unique flags for 284 such ceremonies, court documents said. The majority of the flags were of other countries, however, some were associated with groups or causes, such as the Pride Flag. Camp Constitution sued the city, claiming that Boston’s refusal to let them raise their flag violated the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. In Monday’s ruling, the supreme court said Boston could not discriminate on the basis of the religious group’s viewpoint without violating the Constitution. “We conclude that, on balance, Boston did not make the raising and flying of private groups’ flags a form of government speech,” the supreme court said. “That means, in turn, that Boston’s refusal to let Shurtleff and Camp Constitution raise their flag based on its religious viewpoint ‘abridg[ed]’ their ‘freedom of speech.’” Now, the Satanic Temple wants to raise its own flag — although they aren’t sure which one. “We have several flag designs that have already been in production, and have not yet discussed which might be best for this specific purpose,” Greaves said. The group opened its first official headquarters in Salem in 2016. They don’t view Satan as an evil figure, but as one who dared question authority. The group mostly advocates for the separation of church and state and is known for attempting to get its one-ton goat-headed idol statue put next to the 10 Commandments monument on public grounds. The group recently said in a letter to the Food and Drug Administration that abortion is part of a religious ritual, and preventing access to treatments that can terminate pregnancies violates religious freedom. The announcement was in response to Texas’ abortion law, which went into effect Sept. 1, outlaws abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected. On Monday, a report from Politico stated that the nation’s highest court voted to reverse Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide. “I hope that with the leaked draft of the Supreme Court majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, more people will wake up to the fact that these efforts by The Satanic Temple are actually high stakes frontline battles to preserve the basic rights of all, and not merely clever ‘pranks’ to expose already well-known hypocrisies,” Greaves said."

Speaking at a Thursday event hosted by the Georgetown University's Center on Faith and Justice, Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who is also a member of the committee investigating the Capitol riot, accused former President Donald Trump of attempting to organize a coup to circumvent Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election and stay in power. During the talk, he called special attention to a tense moment involving Pence, NBC News reported. After being taken to an undisclosed portion of the Capitol during the riot, Pence's Secret Service agents, whom Raskin suspected were reporting directly to Trump's security detail, asked him to enter an armored limousine. The intent, some have theorized, was to drive Pence away from the building, preventing him from certifying the election results, after he had signaled his unwillingness to go against his duties and keep Trump in power. ""[Pence] uttered what I think are the six most chilling words of this entire thing I've seen so far: 'I'm not getting in that car,'"" Raskin said. ""He knew exactly what this inside coup they had planned for was going to do."" This moment was previously reported during an interview for the book I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year, by Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. According to Tim Giebels, the lead agent inside of Pence's security on January 6, Pence repeatedly refused to be evacuated from the Capitol until the election results were certified, The Washington Examiner reported. I'm not getting in the car, Tim,"" Pence said, in response to Giebels' insistence that he enter the armored vehicle. ""I trust you, Tim, but you're not driving the car. If I get in that vehicle, you guys are taking off. I'm not getting in the car."" Raskin discussed the House select committee's investigation further on Thursday, alleging in no uncertain terms that Trump and his closest confidants attempted to organize a coup following the 2020 election. ""This was not a coup directed at the president,"" the congressman said. ""It was a coup directed by the president against the vice president and against the Congress."""

Bernie Sanders and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney don't see eye-to-eye when it comes to canceling student debt. On Wednesday, after President Joe Biden had indicated to some Democratic lawmakers that he is open to forgiving at least $10,000 in student debt, Romney called the relief a ""bribe"" for voters. Sanders — an advocate for complete student-loan forgiveness — didn't agree. ""Mr. Romney supports 'bribes' in the form of tax cuts for the wealthy and billions in welfare for corporations, but is shocked by the idea that working Americans might get help paying off student debt,"" Sanders wrote on Twitter on Thursday. ""I know he thinks corporations are people, but does he know people are people?"" Romney later told an NBC News reporter that Sanders ""needs to go to Econ 101. And I keep suggesting that's a good idea, that it'd be helpful for him to understand that money does not grow on trees."" The student-loan forgiveness debate has been buzzing this week, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers on high alert. After a speech on Ukraine aid on Thursday, Biden told reporters that he will ""have an answer"" on student-debt relief in the coming weeks. He noted that $50,000 in relief is off the table, but he's considering some form of debt forgiveness prior to the resumption of student-loan payments after August 31. Republicans have consistently slammed the notion of student-loan forgiveness due to its cost to taxpayers and the economy. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine criticized the potential Biden move on Thursday, arguing any debt relief would be unfair to people who paid it back. Sanders and his Democratic colleagues have maintained forgiving student debt will be an economic stimulus and benefit those who need it the most.  ""This is a problem in our society,"" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told Insider. ""We should fix it."""

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia insisted under oath that she does not remember expressing support for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's execution in 2019. The congresswoman's assertion came amidst an administrative hearing in Atlanta about whether she can be disqualified from serving in Congress for supporting an insurrection against the United States. Lawyers from Free Speech for the People, the group challenging Greene's candidacy, presented the congresswoman with a print-out of a CNN article that documented Greene's prior support for political violence against some Democrats. ""She's a traitor to our country, she's guilty of treason,"" Greene said of Pelosi in a 2019 Facebook video, according to CNN. ""She took an oath to protect American citizens and uphold our laws. And she gives aid and comfort to our enemies who illegally invade our land. That's what treason is. And by our law representatives and senators can be kicked out and no longer serve in our government. And it's, uh, it's a crime punishable by death is what treason is. Nancy Pelosi is guilty of treason."" But asked about those comments at the hearing on Friday, Greene insisted she had no recollection of making those remarks. ""According to this CNN article I did,"" she quipped when asked repeatedly by both the lawyers and the judge presiding over the hearing. ""I don't recall saying all of this, but I do recall having said this about the — I totally disagree with the border issue."" Greene also denied knowledge of several other statements and social media posts brought forward by the group. At one point, Greene was questioning about the fact that her Facebook account liked a post from a commenter stating that ""a bullet to the head would be quicker"" to remove Pelosi. Asked about that comment, she bashed CNN. ""You're using a CNN article, which has lie — CNN has lied about me multiple times,"" she said, despite that fact that CNN provided documentation and links to the original posts in their 2021 article. She then grinned widely as the lawyer with Free Speech for the People repeated the question. ""I've had many people manage my social media account over the years, I have no idea who liked that,"" she insisted. ""I do not know."" That same CNN article is heavily cited in the group's complaint arguing that Greene was supportive of an insurrection. Under Section 3 of Article 14 of the US Constitution, ""no person"" who's taken an oath and served as a member of Congress ""shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion."" Greene had previously sought to block the hearing from happening, but a federal judge in Georgia ruled on Monday that the challenge could go forward. She is the first member of Congress to testify under oath about the events of January 6."

Mike Lee assisting Trump efforts to overturn 2020 election,"Newly released text messages between Sen. Mike Lee and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows show Lee was advising and assisting former President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The messages also reveal Lee was aware of a legally dubious strategy to have then-Vice President Mike Pence throw out Electoral College votes much earlier than he had claimed. CNN published almost 100 text messages from Lee and Texas Rep. Chip Roy to Meadows in the aftermath of Trump’s 2020 election loss. The texts trace how Lee went from being a fierce advocate for Trump’s efforts to warning the White House that the scheme could backfire. Lee eventually announced he was opposed to a plan to have Congress object to the Electoral College results in some battleground states, but the texts reveal that only came after Lee worked for months to assist Trump’s efforts. Lee’s efforts to assist Trump began Nov. 7, the day Democrat Joe Biden was declared the winner. He texted Meadows a statement signed by the leaders of several prominent conservative groups urging Trump to “exhaust every legal and constitutional remedy” in challenging the results. “Use it however you deem appropriate,” Lee wrote. “And if it’s helpful to you for you to leak it, feel free to do so.” Lee also pressed Meadows to help lawyer Sidney Powell gain access to Trump. Powell alleged a secret cabal, including George Soros, the late Hugo Chávez, the CIA and thousands of election officials, conspired to steal votes from Trump in 2020. “Sydney (sic) Powell is saying she needs to get in to see the president, but she’s being kept away from him. Apparently she has a strategy to keep things alive and put several states back in play. Can you help her get in?” Lee wrote to Meadows on Nov. 7. Two days later, Lee again reached out to Meadows on behalf of Powell. “Sidney told us the campaign lawyer who do not know are not focused on this and are obstructing progress. I have no way of verifying or refuting that on my own, but I’ve found her to be a straight shooter,” Lee wrote. Powell’s conspiracy claims resulted in her being sued for defamation by Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Powell is facing multiple disciplinary actions, including disbarment, in several states for her actions following the 2020 election. On Nov. 19, Lee realizes his backing of Powell may have been a mistake following a disastrous news conference where she detailed bizarre claims about a global communist plot to rig the election against Trump. “I’m worried about the Powell press conference,” Lee wrote in the first in a series of text messages. “Unless Powell can back up everything she said, which I kind of doubt she can.” Over the next three days, Lee reached out to Meadows several times, asking for marching orders. “Please give me something to work with. I just need to know what I should be saying,” Lee wrote on Nov. 19. “Please tell me what I should be saying,” Lee asked the next day. On Nov. 23, Lee first brings up lawyer John Eastman, suggesting some irregularities in several states and proposing an audit. “Eastman has some really interesting research on this. The good news is is (sic) that Eastman is proposing an approach that unlike what Sidney Powell has propose (sic) could be examined very quickly,” Lee said. Eastman was behind a scheme to subvert the election results by having a handful of states carried by Biden submit alternate slates of electors. Competing slates would allow the Vice President to reject the results from those states, possibly throwing the election to the House of Representatives to keep Trump in the White House. Lee claimed he first learned of the Eastman plan on Jan. 2, when he received a copy of a confidential memo from the White House. He told authors Bob Woodward and Robert Costa he was “surprised” by the plan and made “phone call after phone call” to see if any states were ready to certify alternate electors but found none. In reality, Lee was aware of the gambit nearly a month before he claimed. On Dec. 8, Lee texted Meadows, “If a very small handful of states were to have their legislatures appoint alternative slates of delegates, there could be a plan,” Lee wrote. “I am working on that as of yesterday,” Meadows replied. (Patrick Semansky | AP) Then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Oct. 30, 2020. Eastman invoked his Fifth Amendment rights when questioned by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Eastman was asked about his communications with Lee but also pleaded the Fifth. On Dec. 16, Lee asked Meadows if they wanted any senators to object to the certification of electoral votes, which was part of the Eastman plan to throw out the results. But Lee appeared to be cooling on the plan, realizing such a move may not be legal. “Also, if you want senators to object, we need to hear from you on that ideally getting some guidance on what arguments to raise,” Lee wrote. “I think we’re now passed the point where we can expect anyone will do it without some direction and a strong evidentiary argument,” Lee added. The next available message to Meadows came on Jan. 3, when he warned of the efforts by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others to object to the election results. “I have grave concerns with the way my friend Ted is going about this effort,” Lee wrote. “This will not inure to the benefit of the president.” But, Lee was still hoping that some states would certify alternate slates of electors, making objecting to the results much easier. “Everything changes, of course, if the swing states submit competing slates of electors pursuant to state law,” Lee said. Lee warns Meadows that the effort to have Congress give the win to Trump could backfire on the president. “I know only this will end badly for the president unless we have the Constitution on our side. And unless these states submit new slates of Trump electors pursuant to state law, we do not,” Lee wrote. The next day, Trump took a public shot at Lee during a rally in Georgia after Lee announced he did not support objecting to the election results. “Mike Lee is here, but I’m a little angry at him,” Trump said. Lee was not happy about being publicly called out by the president and vented to Meadows. “I’ve been spending 14 hours a day for the last week trying to unravel this for him. To have him take a shot at me like that in such a public setting without even asking me about it is pretty discouraging,” Lee said. Lee explained he had been calling legislators in several states trying to develop a way to defend Congress throwing out results in favor of Trump. In one text, Lee suggested he was trying to convince those state lawmakers to manufacture a pretext for Congress to act. “We need something from state legislatures to make this legitimate and to have any hope of winning. Even if they can’t convene, it might be enough if a majority of them are willing to sign a statement indicating how they would vote,” Lee wrote. Ultimately, Lee did not join other Republicans in objecting to the results. The Tribune has reached out to Sen. Lee’s office for comment. Lee is facing Republicans Becky Edwards and Ally Isom in a June primary election as he seeks a third term in Congress. In a statement to The Tribune, Edwards ripped Lee for his involvement in the scheme to overturn the election results. “Sen. Mike Lee researched overturning a lawful, democratic election for partisan and political gain. The moment Lee realized the gravity of Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election, he should have stopped researching the legality of such actions and stopped pressuring local legislators,” Edwards’ campaign said in a text message. “Lee has an obligation to protect and defend our Constitution and democratic process, as he swore to do when he took office. Instead, he allowed the situation to continue and enabled those seeking to keep themselves in power, no matter the consequences,” Edwards added. In a statement, Isom said the text messages from Lee have wrecked his credibility. “When a sitting US senator asks what he should say, he is freely admitting he is more concerned with playing DC games — with the politics of politics — rather than the people of Utah. Utah wants someone to fight for our state — someone who refuses to be just another chess piece the Washington, DC, apparatus can push around,” Isom said. Independent U.S. Senate candidate Evan McMullin also jumped on Lee’s text messages, suggesting Lee tried to obscure his involvement in the election scheme. “Why did Sen. Mike lee advise spurious legal efforts to overturn the 2020 election? And why did he hide those plans in the days leading up to Jan. 6?” McMullin said on Twitter, connecting his post to a fundraising appeal. Democratic candidate Kael Weston chimed in, saying Lee was acting more like Trump’s lawyer instead of representing Utah. “Instead of plotting with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to further divide our nation & undermine our democracy, Lee should have been working on behalf of Utahns who pay his salary,” Weston tweeted."

Abbott's border inspections prompt Mexico to move lucrative trade link to New Mexico,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's (R) 10-day-long ""enhanced"" safety inspections of commercial trucks entering the state from Mexico may have cost Texas $4.2 billion in economic damage, as estimated by Waco-based Perryman Group, but it's been great for business in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, a border crossing just across state lines from El Paso. Trucks were re-routed through Santa Teresa when Abbott's inspections snarled commercial traffic at Texas border crossings, and now Mexico has decided to move a long-planned trade railway connection worth billions of dollars from Texas to the New Mexico crossing, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday. ""We're now not going to use Texas,"" Mexican Economy Minister Tatiana Clouthier said. ""We can't leave all the eggs in one basket and be hostages to someone who wants to use trade as a political tool."" Clouthier made her announcement in Mexico City on Thursday, a day before Abbott said he will be transferring another $500 million from other Texas agencies to finance his broader state border initiative, Operation Lone Star, which is already costing Texans more than $2 billion a year. Jerry Pacheco, president of the Santa Teresa's Border Industrial Association, told the Morning News that Mexico has plenty of time to change its mind about the lucrative T-MEC Corridor trade link, but ""the very fact that we're being discussed in the early stages is a positive thing."" He added that ""since Gov. Abbott's truck inspections went away, our traffic numbers remain higher than normal in terms of northbound cargo shipments, which leads me to believe that what I thought would be a temporary fix is actually going to stick in the long term."" ""We also absolutely play politics with the border,"" Pacheco said, ""but we play to bring more trade from Mexico through our New Mexico ports of entry, not to impede trade."""

In a blog post, Natasha Sarin, the Treasury's counselor for tax policy and implementation, once again laid out some of the challenges facing the underfunded agency. Sarin points to the example of other countries to look at what an ""adequately funded tax administrator"" would mean for Americans. For instance, Sarin writes, ""in many developed countries, tax filing is simple and costless."" Sarin cites the Atlantic's reporting that the average Estonian spends just five minutes doing taxes — and that it's even easier in Sweden, where many taxpayers just have to reply ""yes"" to a text message to confirm their taxes. On the other hand, the IRS is still opening mountains of paper returns by hand, and running out of crucial everyday items like carts and staples. ""Today's deadline is an inflection point in what has been the agency's most challenging filing season in recent history,"" Sarin wrote. ""This is the byproduct of chronic underfunding that has starved the IRS of the tools it needs to serve the American people, coupled with a historic pandemic that introduced new responsibilities alongside mammoth challenges."" For months, the Treasury department — and the IRS's own commissioner — have been sounding the alarm bell on how understaffed and underfunded the agency is. According to the Tax Policy Center, the IRS' budget has shrunk by over 20% in the last decade, much of it due to Republican-led budget cuts. At the same time, demand — as measured by returns — has ramped up by 19%, according to national taxpayer advocate Erin Collins. Staffing is also low: Sarin writes that the agency's workforce is at ""1970s levels."" That's led to a historic backlog of tax returns. The IRS was still sitting on 6.2 million unprocessed individual returns at the end of 2021, according to IRS watchdog Collins. The IRS has been making a dent in that, slowly but surely. On April 7, IRS commissioner Chuck Rettig testified at a Congressional hearing that the agency now had 2.7 million paper returns filed in calendar year 2021 sitting in inventory. Those delays have left millions of Americans waiting on their tax refunds for months. Some taxpayers told Insider that missing checks have meant they're having trouble affording groceries, childcare, or even their homes. Democrats sought to ramp up IRS funding as part of their defunct Build Back Better legislation. They set aside $80 billion meant to help the IRS hire additional auditors and employees capable of sorting through a hefty backlog of paper returns. But the House-approved bill stalled out in the Senate due to resistance from at least one centrist when Democrats needed unanimity to pass it. The IRS remains a perennial target for conservatives wary of tax increases. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida released a Republican platform last month that urged slashing the agency's budget by half. It prompted IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to tell House lawmakers last month that ""you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely"" if that was implemented."

Benjamin Franklin had set himself to adapting it for the American colonies. Though Franklin already had a long and successful career by this point, he needed to find a way to convince colonial book-buyers—who for the most part didn’t even formally study arithmetic—that his version of George Fisher’s textbook was worth the investment. Franklin made all sorts of changes throughout the book, from place names to inserting colonial histories, but he made one really big change: adding John Tennent’s The Poor Planter’s Physician to the end. Tennent was a Virginia doctor whose medical pamphlet had first appeared in 1734.* By appending it to The Instructor (replacing a treatise on farriery) Franklin hoped to distinguish the book from its London ancestor. Franklin advertised that his edition was “the whole better adapted to these American Colonies, than any other book of the like kind.” In the preface he goes on to specifically mention his swapping out of sections, insisting that “in the British Edition of this Book, there were many Things of little or no Use in these Parts of the World: In this Edition those Things are omitted, and in their Room many other Matters inserted, more immediately useful to us Americans.” One of those useful “Matters” was a how-to on at-home abortion, made available to anyone who wanted a book that could teach the ABCs and 123s. In this week’s leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, “The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions.” Yet abortion was so “deeply rooted” in colonial America that one of our nation’s most influential architects went out of his way to insert it into the most widely and enduringly read and reprinted math textbook of the colonial Americas—and he received so little pushback or outcry for the inclusion that historians have barely noticed it is there. Abortion was simply a part of life, as much as reading, writing, and arithmetic. [Read: Alito’s Leaked Draft Fully Overruling Roe Is Unprecedented] Franklin wasn’t even the first issuer of a math textbook on either side of the Atlantic to include among its materials a recipe for abortion, though his book certainly had the most reliable and explicit one. William Mather’s 1699 Young Man’s Companion also has one (the London book would inspire the very first arithmetic book to be printed in the colonies in 1705, by Franklin’s old boss Andrew Bradford). In Mather’s book, though, the recipe was short, misleading, and ineffective. It includes an entry for “Terms provoked,” a heading also found under comparable medical books with abortifacient concoctions (where the “term,” or period, needs “provoking”). Unfortunately for Mather’s readers, however, he prescribes “stinking Arach,” or goosefoot, which is an emmenagogue (an agent to stimulate or regulate menstruation) but not a reliable abortifacient. He also makes the even more dubious suggestion to “take a draught of White wine” under a full moon. But Franklin’s choice to get Tennent’s pamphlet into the hands of readers all over the colonies meant that anyone learning to read, write, and calculate with his book would also have access to the leading available treatment for ending a pregnancy. Tennent’s handbook prescribes angelica, an herb known to be an effective abortifacient in the early stages of pregnancy for thousands of years, and which was frequently recommended across early modern herbal books.* Moreover, the recipe refers to several herbal abortifacients known at the time: For this Misfortune, you must purge with Highland Flagg, (commonly called Bellyach Root) a Week before you expect to be out of Order; and repeat the same two Days after; the next Morning drink a Quarter of Pint of Pennyroyal Water, or Decoction, with 12 Drops of Spirits of Harts-horn, and as much again at Night, when you go to Bed. Continue this 9 Days running; and after resting 3 Days, go on with it for 9 more. The entry combines attention to potent herbs with careful accounting of dosage to treat the “misfortune.” Here the entry recommends acting early before someone might “expect to be out of order” with their next period. This is consistent with the timing for maximum efficacy for angelica, aka “Bellyach Root,” a plant member of the carrot family. Likewise, pennyroyal was known even to the ancient Greeks as a form of birth control; “Harts-horn,” or century plant, was also commonly recommended at the time as part of concoctions for abortions and expelling afterbirth. The entry concludes by advising that the patients “shou’d be cautious of taking Opiates too often, or Jesuits-Bark”—a remedy for malaria sometimes mistakenly thought to be an abortifacient—and just in case anyone was not clear on what caused this malady, “nor must they long for pretty Fellows, or any other Trash whatsoever.” So: avoid sex. The recipe details, moreover, assume that these “unmarry’d Women” had the kind of knowledge of arithmetic that the book’s earlier instructional sections had taught. The recipe insists on careful attention to measurement and counting. And it asks the preparer to work with repeated multiples of three. Franklin had a track record of promoting female education, and of arithmetic for them in particular. He advocates for it in his early, anonymous “Silence Dogood” articles, and in his Autobiography singles out a Dutch printer’s widow who saved the family business thanks to her education. There, Franklin makes an explicit call “recommending that branch of education for our young females.” He likely hoped that his American Instructor would reach audiences that included women and girls; and based on his choice of which medical book to reprint, he may also have understood that the Dutch widow would have needed to know how to end an unwanted pregnancy just as much as she would need to know how to balance an account book. In a 1760 edition of The American Instructor held by the American Antiquarian Society, a reader has pulled out the page that included the abortion recipe, either to save it from or to save it for prying eyes. Another copy, held at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, shows that the Gilbert family treasured the book so much that they used it as kind of a family Bible starting in 1755, with Thomas Gilbert entering the names and birthdates of his children into it, even including the five-day duration of Rachel Gilbert’s labor with their daughter Sarah. Births, abortions, arithmetic—all of them were wrapped up together and taken for granted in this colonial American book, which thanks to Franklin circulated far and wide and for generations, including among enslaved Americans. In 1771, two Black men, both fugitives from enslavement, left at night from Nanjemoy, Maryland, in search of freedom and took with them a gun, powder, and two books, one of which was “Fisher’s Arithmetick.” As an early American literary critic who works on the history of numeracy, I thought of Franklin’s book multiple times while I read the news this past week. Florida legislators want to excise social and emotional learning exercises from math textbooks for children, as though presenting arithmetic without context has ever been helpful or even the norm. And now, should some version of this draft Supreme Court opinion hold, the ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health will render abortion effectively illegal for myself, my students, and my daughters here in central Ohio, where new Intel factories are about to require tens of thousands of workers with advanced quantitative skills. For many of us, abortion access is an essential part of STEM education. It keeps us in school; it keeps the kids we already have fed and housed while they’re in school. And it is simply health care—like treatment for the umpteen other maladies listed in the colonial medical handbook. Alito’s draft argues that “Roe and Casey must be overruled,” pointing out that “the Constitution makes no reference to abortion.” Maybe so, but for the Framers’ contemporaries who learned to count with Franklin’s help, safe and accessible abortion was a matter of simple math."

""Had we moved the weapons to Ukraine earlier, that they could defend themselves, it would have saved thousands of lives and probably the decision of Putin not to enter."""
/r/politics/comments/uh7crn/we_told_you_this_was_coming_but_you_didnt_listen/,1651549340,https://www.thedailybeast.com/we-told-you-that-the-supreme-court-was-coming-to-kill-roe-v-wade-and-more-but-you-didnt-listen?via=twitter_page,42503,Gay Marriage Is Next Up on the Supreme Court Chopping Block,"I am approximately zero percent surprised by the draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, authored by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, that was leaked to Politico. Not only am I unsurprised—I predicted it, several times, in this publication. And not just me, of course, but everyone in my profession. Overturning Roe is in the Republican Party’s platform. It was the primary criterion that the Federalist Society, funded by religious extremists, used to pick Supreme Court justices for Donald Trump. Together with desegregation, it propelled the Religious Right to get into politics 50 years ago, and vote for Republicans ever since. So, yes, we all told you this was inevitable. And now it is here. But “you”—by which I mean the large majority of voters who say that women have a right to control their own bodies—didn’t listen. The Supreme Court ranked at the bottom of Democrats’ concerns in 2016, while it was at the top of Republicans’. Even after the unprecedented and norm-shattering mistreatment of judicial nominee Merrick Garland, many centrist voters didn’t care and some left-wing voters didn’t think it was enough to stomach voting for Hillary Clinton. So we got Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, and now, if this draft becomes the majority opinion, we’ve got the end of Roe v. Wade. But that’s only the beginning of the end. If the reasoning of the draft becomes the majority opinion—and it is worth stressing that this is by no means assured, since it is a draft and may well be watered down by other justices—then it applies equally to Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that all marriages (including my same-sex one) are protected by the Constitution; to Lawrence v. Texas, which held that all intimate sexual activity (including same-sex) was too; and to Griswold v. Connecticut, which held that the right to access contraception is as well. “What can liberals do now? Not much, really. It’s too fucking late.” All those cases held that certain specific rights to bodily integrity and privacy, though unmentioned in the Constitution, are implicit in the broad guarantees of the 14th Amendment, as long as they were part of the “concept of ordered liberty.” It’s not part of the concept of liberty to police a woman’s uterus or a gay man’s bedroom. There are limits to government power, and no process can be “due process” if it transgresses those limits. But in so-called Originalism, a once-fringe legal theory that is now the gospel of half the Supreme Court, a right must also be “part of the Nation’s history and traditions” to be protected. Sorry, women and gays, you’re not part of our white-male-dominated history and traditions, so the constitution doesn’t protect you. To be clear, Justice Alito didn’t leave this to speculation. He specifically mentioned Obergefell and Lawrence as examples of the same faulty reasoning behind Roe. So, in case folks weren’t listening when all those legal Cassandras warned that Roe was going to be overturned, please listen now: Gay marriage is too. Within a year or two. Unless another justice leaves the court, the constitutional right to marriage for all is going to be overturned. The only question is whether Republicans will have a veto-proof majority (or the presidency in 2024) to ban both abortion and gay marriage anywhere in the nation. I’m not sure where that leaves my custody of my child, but I can tell you that I am certain that my family will not be protected by the Constitution two years from now. “My family will not be protected by the Constitution two years from now. ” So, what can liberals do now? Not much, really. It’s too fucking late. What liberals should have done in 2016 was ensure that a Democrat won the oval office. They should have arm-twisted their Jill Stein friends, and let their Republican relatives know that, hey, women are people and shouldn’t be forced by the government to carry a fetus (or a blastocyst, or an embryo) inside of their womb. And that those very rights were at stake in 2016, and again in the Senate elections of 2018, and again in 2020, and again in the Senate elections this year. Of course, I’m sure liberals will hold marches, because that’s what we like to do. March and rally and chant. We like to do things that give ourselves the illusion of power. That’s why liberals reduce their “carbon footprints,” even though that concept is a neo-liberal scam, invented by British Petroleum to dodge collective responsibility for climate change and place it on individuals instead. It’s why liberals think that occupying a public square is a “victory,” even if it accomplishes nothing. The question is, will liberals continue to sublimate their rage into meaningless acts that make them feel better, or will they exercise actual power, by voting Democrats into office on local, state, and national levels, and by demanding that the desecration of the Supreme Court that took place during the Trump years (and the last of Obama’s) be corrected immediately, by changing the size of the court or enacting term limits or both? And in the meantime, will liberals donate enough money to pro-abortion organizations so that every woman who wants one can travel to a state where her rights are still respected? Will moderate white women—looking at you, Susan Collins—finally realize that a party that sells out to Christian theocrats is not looking out for their best interests? I’m ashamed to admit that I still have a little optimism here. As I’ve written before, I think the abortion case and the gun control case (don’t forget that one—half the nation’s gun safety laws are likely to be struck down too) have the capacity to energize two non-overlapping groups essential to the Democrats’ success: young progressives (especially people of color) and moderate white women. Without minimizing the gigantic practical and symbolic damage this decision will do on women across the country, I still have some flickering hope that it will also wake up enough people to make a difference in November. In the meantime, all I can say to all of my female friends, as we watch your rights be stripped away by Christian extremists placed on the Supreme Court by other Christian extremists, is that I’ll be joining you soon. They’ve never accepted our full humanity, and now they’re putting us back in our places. Jay Michaelson"

Mallory McMorrow appeared on MSNBC’sMorning Joe, saying that “there was an opportunity for the Republican Party to go back to debating how we spend tax dollars,” but that they’re instead using “full fringe QAnon hateful, hateful rhetoric with no actual policy”. “Part of the reason I really wanted to identify myself is because this moment is going to require straight, white, Christian, suburban moms to stand up and get uncomfortable and say this is not okay,” she added during the Wednesday morning interview. “Because odds are, a lot of us are probably pretty comfortable and okay, but that doesn’t mean that this is okay. And we can’t stand back and let it happen,” she said. After a Republican state senator accused the Democratic legislator of supporting attempts to “groom” and “sexualise” children in a campaign fundraising email, Ms McMorrow took her response to the floor of the state capitol. “I sat on it for a while wondering, ‘Why me?’ And then I realised – I am the biggest threat to your hollow, hateful scheme,” she said in remarks on 19 April. “You can’t claim that you are targeting marginalised kids in the name of ‘parental rights’ if another parent is standing up to say ‘no’.” In an email soliciting donations to her campaign on 18 April, Senator Lana Theis heaped together a list of right-wing tropes that have dominated GOP campaigns in 2022, alleging that “our children are under assault in our schools” from “gender-bending indoctrination” and “race-based education” promoted by their political opponents. She also lashed out at Ms McMorrow, claiming she is among a group of “progressive social media trolls” who are “outraged they can’t teach, can’t groom and sexualise kindergarteners or that 8-year-olds are responsible for slavery,” without pointing to any such evidence, as GOP officials and right-wing personalities invoke baseless smears against LGBT+ people and their allies relying on the same language. In furious five-minute remarks that went viral across social media on Tuesday, Ms McMorrow condemned the attacks and placed them within a broader, toxic national campaign to distort concepts like “critical race theory” and LGBT+ people for political leverage. During her speech on Tuesday, Ms McMorrow said, “I am a straight, white, Christian, married suburban mom, who knows that the very notion that learning about slavery or redlining or systemic racism somehow means that ‘children are being taught to feel bad and hate themselves because they are white’ is absolute nonsense”. “No child alive today is responsible for slavery,” she said. “No one in this room is responsible for slavery. But each and every single one of us bears responsibility for writing the next chapter of history. … We are not responsible for the past. We also cannot change the past. We can’t pretend that it didn’t happen, or deny people their very right to exist.” “This is the Michigan Republican Party right now. This is the national Republican Party right now,” she told MSNBC on Wednesday. “It’s disgusting, it’s hateful, it’s horrible.” Ms McMorrow said Ms Theis “said nothing back” after her speech, adding that she “couldn’t even be bothered to look me in the eye. I looked at the back of her head the entire speech. She turned away from me”. “I have never been one to shy away from saying things to people’s face and she’s too much of a coward to even acknowledge my existence,” she added. Asked what has happened with moderate Republicans in her state, Ms McMorrow spoke about “rising extremism and we’ve seen this play out with gerrymandering”. “The fact is Michigan is a very purple state. We vote pretty evenly Democratic versus Republican, but the legislature, particularly in the state senate, has been Republican-controlled since 1984 despite the fact that in 2014, they only got less than 50 per cent of the votes,” she added. “They got 72 per cent of the Senate seats, and it encourages going further and further to the fringes.” “We had an attempted kidnapping of” Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer and on “the day that we learned in the Senate about that plot, the Senate Majority Leader walked out of our Senate chambers, walked to the front of our capitol and rallied with the same hateful conspiracy theorist that plotted that kidnapping, that came to our chambers fully armed and threatened us, and told them to keep going,” Ms McMorrow said. “That’s where we’re at right now. And unless we push back and vote them out of office, it’s not going to get any better.” Asked about the response to her speech, she said “the numbers speak for themselves”. As of Wednesday morning, her speech had received almost 9 million views on Twitter. “This is definitely not something that I’m wanting to do to go viral. But if the message is that hate won’t win, I think we’re proving that and we have to say it loudly and clearly and stand up for those who are being attacked because one day it might be us,” she told MSNBC. “And I know that everything that I felt the day that Lana Theis accused me of being a groomer and sexualizing children is that much worse for a trans kid who was getting attacked every single day who just wants to go to school and have friends and get through the day,” she added. “The response has been overwhelming. And my hope is that other white women like me who are doing okay, are the ones to stand up and put an end to this because it won’t unless we do,” she said. The Independent has reached out to Ms Theis for comment."
/r/politics/comments/u6tq74/effort_to_remove_marjorie_taylor_greene_from/,1650333491,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/us/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-jan-6.html,41362,"Effort to Remove Marjorie Taylor Greene From Ballot Can Proceed, Judge Says","A federal judge cleared the way on Monday for a group of Georgia voters to move forward with legal efforts seeking to disqualify Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for re-election to Congress, citing her role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. The disqualification effort is based on a constitutional provision adopted after the Civil War that barred members of the Confederacy from holding office. It mirrors several other cases involving Republican members of Congress, whose roles leading up to and during the deadly riot have drawn intense criticism. The judge, Amy Totenberg, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by President Barack Obama, denied Ms. Greene’s request for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order in the high-profile legal feud. Ms. Greene, 47, who is known for her unflinching loyalty to former President Donald J. Trump and for her clashes with Democrats, has steadfastly denied that she aided and engaged in the attack on the Capitol. In the 73-page ruling, Judge Totenberg wrote that Ms. Greene had failed to meet the “burden of persuasion” in her request for injunctive relief, which she called an extraordinary and drastic remedy. “This case involves a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import,” Judge Totenberg wrote. “The novelty of the factual and historical posture of this case — especially when assessed in the context of a preliminary injunction motion reviewed on a fast track — has made resolution of the complex legal issues at stake here particularly demanding.” James Bopp Jr., a lawyer for Ms. Greene, said on Monday night that the ruling was flawed and minimized the adverse effect that the disqualification effort was having on Ms. Greene’s right to run for office. “This is fundamentally antidemocratic,” Mr. Bopp said, maintaining that Ms. Greene had “publicly and vigorously condemned the attack on the Capitol.” He called the effort to remove her from the ballot part of a well-funded nationwide effort to strip voters of their right to vote for candidates of their choice, with elections determined by “bureaucrats, judges, lawyers and clever legal arguments.” In her request for an injunction, Ms. Greene argued that it would be impossible to fully resolve the case before Georgia holds its primary elections on May 24. Absentee ballots will start to be mailed on April 25, Ms. Greene’s motion said. In the ruling, Judge Totenberg determined that Ms. Greene had failed to prove that there was a strong likelihood that she would prevail on the merits of her legal claims. A state administrative judge is scheduled to hear the case on Friday. The decision by Judge Totenberg stood in stark contrast with a recent ruling in a similar case involving Representative Madison Cawthorn in North Carolina. In blocking that disqualification effort, U.S. District Judge Richard E. Myers II, an appointee of Mr. Trump, ruled that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution narrowly applied to members of the Confederacy after the Civil War. Ms. Greene’s critics have said that she frequently referred to efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential election results as “our 1776 moment” in public comments that led up to the riot at the Capitol. They contend that the phrase was a code used to incite violence, and point to the third section of the 14th Amendment in their argument to drop her from the ballot. That section says that “no person shall” be a member of Congress or hold civil office if they had engaged in insurrection or rebellion after “having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State.” The constitutional challenge to Ms. Greene’s candidacy, filed last month with Georgia’s secretary of state, argued that Ms. Greene had helped to plan the attack on the Capitol or knew that a demonstration organized by Mr. Trump and his supporters on the National Mall would escalate into violence. The group pursuing the case is represented by Free Speech for People, a nonpartisan, nonprofit legal advocacy organization with constitutional law expertise, which was also involved in the case involving Mr. Cawthorn. Ron Fein, the legal director for Free Speech for People, heralded the ruling on Monday night in an email to The New York Times. “Judge Totenberg’s well-reasoned opinion explains why the Georgia voters who filed this challenge against Greene have the right to have their challenge heard, and why none of Greene’s objections to the Georgia state challenge have any merit,” Mr. Fein said. “At the hearing on Friday, we look forward to questioning Greene under oath about her involvement in the events of Jan. 6, and to demonstrating how her facilitation of the insurrection disqualifies her from public office under the United States Constitution.” Last year, the House removed Ms. Greene from the Education and Budget Committees for endorsing the executions of Democrats and spreading dangerous and bigoted misinformation. The move — supported by the majority of Democrats and opposed nearly unanimously by Republicans — diminished Ms. Greene’s influence in the chamber. In January, Twitter permanently suspended Ms. Greene’s personal account after the company said she had violated its Covid-19 misinformation policies. Ms. Greene had tweeted falsehoods about “extremely high amounts of Covid vaccine deaths.” More recently, Ms. Greene filed a threat report with the Capitol Police after the late-night television show host and comedian Jimmy Kimmel mocked her in a monologue. When Mr. Kimmel mentioned Ms. Greene’s barbs toward three Republican senators who voted to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, he said, “Wow, where is Will Smith when you really need him?”"

In a 30-second statement that aired Monday night, a voiceover stated: ""Georgia officials have concluded that there was no widespread voter fraud by election workers who counted ballots at the State Farm Arena in November 2020."" ""The results of this investigation indicate that Ruby Freeman and Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss did not engage in ballot fraud or criminal misconduct,"" the statement said, referring to two election workers for Fulton County, Georgia. ""A legal matter with this network and the two election workers has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties through a fair and reasonable settlement."" The statement was a response to a defamation lawsuit filed against the network by Freeman and Moss, who are mother and daughter. Citing legal documents, Reuters reported in April that Freeman and Moss had reached a settlement with OAN in the case. Freeman and Moss have also filed a defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, the former personal lawyer of former President Donald Trump, the report said. The pair, who helped to administer the 2020 election in the state, said they were subjected to harassment and abuse after baseless rumors pushed by Trump allies that they had interfered with votes as part of a plot to deprive Trump of victory. The former president and his allies, including Giuliani, launched a campaign to overturn Trump's defeat in Georgia, a red-leaning state that voted to elect Joe Biden in 2020. OAN also broadcast reports baselessly alleging that Freeman and Moss had produced fake ballots and registered them in voting machines to steal the election from Trump. An investigation by Georgia officials last October found no evidence of wrongdoing in how the election had been conducted in Fulton County, which had been pivotal to Biden's win and where Trump allies had focused their efforts to overturn the result."
/r/politics/comments/umslqm/schumer_says_he_sees_no_issue_with_protests_at/,1652216325,https://thehill.com/news/senate/3483411-schumer-says-he-sees-no-issue-with-protests-at-houses-of-supreme-court-justices/,40827,Schumer says he sees no issue with peaceful protests at houses of Supreme Court justices,"Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday responded to abortion rights activists protesting at the homes of Supreme Court justices in light of the leaked draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, saying he does not have a problem with it if the protests remain peaceful. “Are you comfortable with the protests that we saw outside the homes of Supreme Court justices over the weekend?” a reporter asked Schumer at a press conference. “If protests are peaceful, yes. My house — there’s protests three, four times a week outside my house. The American way to peacefully protest is OK,” Schumer said before checking his ringing phone, noting his wife was calling him. “Maybe there’s a protest outside,” the New York senator joked. He then reemphasized his earlier point that as long as the protesters remain peaceful, it’s all right that they demonstrate outside the justices’ homes. Schumer’s comments come after protesters in recent days gathered outside the homes of Brett Kavanaugh, John Roberts and the leaked draft opinion’s author, Samuel Alito. The protests have sparked mixed reactions, with some feeling that they are an inappropriate escalation in political demonstrations and others feeling that they are a fair response to the potential loss of a constitutional right. ShutDownDC, an organization that is planning another demonstration in Alito’s neighborhood this week, defended the move in a previous statement to The Hill, saying that “it’s clear that the Justices don’t want to hear public opinion.” “If they won’t listen to us at the building that symbolizes the power they have over us, then they’ll have to listen enough to us at a building that symbolizes just how personal this is—their homes,” a ShutDownDC communications team member said. The news comes as the Senate on Monday passed a bill Monday by unanimous consent that would extend security protections to the immediate family members of Supreme Court justices. Last week, Politico published a draft majority opinion that indicated the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established a federal right to abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. If the draft is reflected in the court’s final ruling, it would effectively end abortion protections at the federal level."

Wade","A bill codifying the right to an abortion failed in the Senate on Wednesday after every Republican senator and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against the measure. The final vote was 49-51, far short of the 60 votes needed to overcome the legislative filibuster threshold. What You Need To Know * A bill codifying the right to an abortion failed in the Senate on Wednesday after every Republican senator and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted against the measure * * The move came in the aftermath of the leaked draft opinion that shows the Supreme Court is set to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion * * While the vote was expected to fail, Democrats wanted to force Republican lawmakers to make a difficult vote ahead of the 2022 midterm elections * * Numerous polls say that a majority of Americans are opposed to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, and several polls suggest that about 60% of Americans support Congress passing a law to establish abortion rights nationwide The move comes in the aftermath of the leaked draft opinion published by Politico that shows the Supreme Court is set to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion. ""Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement after the vote. ""This failure to act comes at a time when women’s constitutional rights are under unprecedented attack – and it runs counter to the will of the majority of American people."" ""Republicans in Congress – not one of whom voted for this bill – have chosen to stand in the way of Americans’ rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives,"" he continued, without mentioning Manchin, the lone Democrat to oppose the bill. While the bill was not expected to pass, it forced Republican lawmakers to cast a difficult vote on the hot-button issue of abortion ahead of November's midterm elections, especially with polls showing a wide majority of Americans oppose the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. Democrats and abortion rights advocates are hoping to make the issue a central focus of the midterm elections in a year that appeared to be perilous for the party, while Republicans have largely tried to steer clear of wading into abortion politics. Biden called on Americans to elect more pro-choice candidates to help enshrine abortion rights into law. ""To protect the right to choose, voters need to elect more pro-choice senators this November, and return a pro-choice majority to the House,"" he said, before pledging: ""If they do, Congress can pass this bill in January, and put it on my desk, so I can sign it into law."" Senate Majority Leader Schumer expressed a similar sentiment: ""The vote we just took makes crystal clear the contrast between the parties as we approach the midterm election. Elect more pro-choice Democrats. If you want to see a woman have control over her own body, elect more pro-choice Democrats. Elect more MAGA Republicans, if you want to see a nationwide ban on abortion, if you want to see doctors and women arrested, if you want to see no exception for rape and incest."" The president pledged that his administration ""will not stop fighting to protect access to women’s reproductive care,"" as did Democrats in leadership. ""We will continue to defend women’s constitutional rights to make private reproductive choices as recognized in Roe v. Wade nearly half a century ago, and my Administration will continue to explore the measures and tools at our disposal to do just that,"" he concluded. ""I am angry and I’m disappointed,"" said Washington Sen. Patty Murray. ""And I’m here to tell you that what we saw today is Republicans telling Americans all over this country and women in particular, that their voice is more important than yours. That what they believe in is more important than your choice about your own body and your own family and your future. I say to women across America, like me and so many others, now is not the time to back down or sit down. Now is the time to lift up our voices and fight back. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do.” “Today, Senate Republicans lined up in lockstep behind Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to vote to rip away the Constitutional right to health freedom from American women across the nation,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. ""While Democrats are fighting to enshrine Roe v. Wade into law, Republicans remain fully committed to punishing and controlling women’s most personal health decisions."" “In this fight, the rights of women – and of all Americans – are on the line,"" she added. ""Democrats will never relent in defending our fundamental freedoms – and the American people will remember who has sought to punish and control women’s decisions and who has fought tirelessly alongside them when they cast their ballots this November.” Vice President Kamala Harris, who presided over Wednesday's vote, said afterwards that ""sadly, the Senate failed to stand in defense of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body."" ""Let's be clear: The majority of the American people believe in defending a woman's right her choice to decide what happens to her own body,"" Harris continued. ""And this clearly suggests that the sadness is not where the majority of Americans are on this issue."" ""It also makes clear that a priority for all who care about this issue should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, state and federal level,"" she added. ""Because what we are seeing around this country are extremist Republican leaders who are seeking to criminalize and punish women for making decisions about her own body."" A number of House lawmakers marched to the Senate ahead of the vote to demonstrate in favor of abortion rights, highlighting the heightened tensions in Washington surrounding the issue of abortion. Majority Leader Schumer last week called it one of the the ""most important"" votes the body will take this year because ""it deals with one of the most personal and difficult decisions a woman ever has to make in her life."" ""Every member of this body will make a choice: Vote to protect the fundamental rights of women across the country or stand with five conservative justices ready to destroy these rights in one fell swoop,"" Schumer said Wednesday. ""What this all comes down to is a fundamental question: Who is making these personal decisions, politicians or a woman?"" said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. But Republicans criticized the vote, saying it was just for show. ""This isn't the first time our friends across the aisle have tried to opportunistically capitalize on events to check items off their liberal wish list,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn. The Women’s Health Protection Act, which passed the House of Representatives in September of last year, needed 60 votes in order to advance in the Senate – an unlikely proposition in an evenly divided chamber. The bill would guarantee the right of a patient to access an abortion, as well as protect the right of a health care provider to administer abortion services. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the bill ""radical,"" saying that ""it ignores modern science"" and ""is tone-deaf to public opinion."" Despite McConnell's claims about public opinion, it should be noted that numerous polls say that a majority of Americans are opposed to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, and several polls suggest that about 60% of Americans support Congress passing a law to establish abortion rights nationwide. A procedural vote on the measure failed earlier this year in a 46-48 vote, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat opposed to abortion rights, joining every Republican Senator present in voting against the measure. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the bill's lead sponsor in the Senate, has modified the legislation to appease some moderates, but it was not enough to sway Manchin's opinion, or that of Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, two Republican lawmakers who support abortion rights. Manchin, who cast the final vote Wednesday, said that while he would support a codification of Roe, this bill goes too far – meaning that a bipartisan group of lawmakers will vote to defeat the measure Wednesday afternoon. Collins, who expressed disappointment with the leaked draft opinion, told reporters last week that she will not support the Democrats' bill, arguing it's too broad and ""doesn’t protect the right of a Catholic hospitals to not perform abortions,"" which she argued ""has been enshrined in law for a long time."" “There is nothing in this measure that detracts in any way from existing protections based on conscience or religion,"" Blumenthal argued in response to Collins' comments. ""It doesn't mandate that a hospital or a doctor or any other provider do anything that is against religious principles."" Collins and Murkowski have authored a competing abortion rights bill, the Reproductive Choice Act, which is more narrow than the Women's Health Protection Act, but would codify Roe and the ""undue burden"" protections from 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Their bill would include exceptions for moral or religious objections. After raising alarm with comments that it is ""possible"" Republicans could push for a nationwide abortion ban should they retake control of the chamber, Leader McConnell sought to downplay those remarks, saying it's highly unlikely they'd garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome the filibuster, and he would not change the filibuster rule ""for any subject."" “I think it’s safe to say there aren’t 60 votes there at the federal level, no matter who happens to be in the majority, no matter who happens to be in the White House,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters. “So I think the widespread sentiment of my conference is this issue will be dealt with at the state level.” But Democrats are trying to sound the alarm on those comments anyway, with the hopes of putting Roe v. Wade on the ballot in November's midterm elections, which seemed precarious for the party prior to the leaked draft opinion due to rising inflation and relatively low approval ratings for President Biden. Biden called on Americans to elect ""more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe,"" and Schumer called Wednesday's vote ""one of the most important votes we take in this chamber in decades."" ""Americans strongly oppose getting rid of Roe, and they will be paying close attention from now until November to Republicans who are responsible for its demise,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. ""So, to my Republican colleagues who have spent the last week trying to talk about anything other than Roe, it's time to go on record. I ask my colleagues to think carefully about their vote, and to reckon deeply about the consequences of a world where Roe is a thing of the past."""

While they may be seen by some as two sides of the same MAGA coin among fierce Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump, Politico reported that, in private, Republicans say that Ms Boebert despises being connected to Ms Greene. The outlet also noted that Ms Boebert is considered to be more of a team player in the party, while both of them are disdained by Democrats for their aggressive rhetoric. At a gathering of the House Freedom Caucus board of directors earlier this year not far from the Capitol in downtown Washington, DC, they reportedly got into an argument over Ms Greene’s appearance at an event organized by a white nationalist. The spat became so ferocious that a least one bystander grew worried that the conflict might have become more than verbal if another member of the board hadn’t stepped in to calm down the situation, Politico reported. Three people confirmed the incident to the outlet. Caucus members mostly avoided publically criticising Ms Greene and Arizona Representative Paul Gosar, and instead aimed their fire at event organizer Nick Fuentes. The argument shows the larger conflict within the House Freedom Caucus, which was founded in 2015 with the aim of dragging Republican leadership to the right, and later became a Trump support squad. There have been conflicts within the caucus concerning how to respond to the tapes showing that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy privately suggested that Mr Trump resign in the wake of the Capitol riot and if the group should move back towards its beginnings of advocating for a smaller state. “We need to reevaluate where we’re heading,” Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee told Politico. “I like the principles that the Freedom Caucus was founded on, but I think that if we can’t work together as a group and push our ideas in a civil manner, then we’re not going to be very effective.” The outlet notes that the party has become less constricted by policy ideas, moving in the Trump era in a more populist and nationalist direction. Some members of the caucus believe that if the group doesn’t return to its beginnings, they might see their impact decrease as the GOP appear poised to take back the House in November’s midterms. Some of the members who were present when the group was founded have indicated that they would prefer if the caucus would use policy fights to push the GOP further to the right and possibly form partnerships with party leaders who would rather focus on criticising Joe Biden than fight intra-party battles. “We were supposed to be thoughtful conservative renegades – cooperating with leadership when that best served conservative goals, and opposing leadership when that was necessary toward the same end,” former South Carolina Representative Mick Mulvaney told Politico. He was a founding member of the Freedom Caucus who went on to serve as Mr Trump’s acting chief of staff and budget director. “We were not designed to be just obstructionists,” he added. “We were not designed to be an extreme outrage machine.” “Their identity really kind of got shook up in the Trump years,” Alabama Representative Mike Rogers, who’s not a member of the caucus, recently said. “The party is different.” “When we’re back in the majority, they’re going to go right back to their bad habits,” he added. “At least the militant wing of that group will become obstructionist again.” The Independent has reached out to Reps Boebert and Greene for comment."

Jackson Women’s Health Organization case appeared to seal the fate of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. As one of the most esteemed liberal justices to sit on the bench, Ginsburg had scoffed at the idea of retiring before she felt that she could “no longer do the job”. Following multiple bouts with cancer and a broken hip her ability to conquer each health obstacle with perseverance and strength turned her into a living feminist folk hero and rock star until her death at the age of 87. She seemed indestructible, until she wasn’t. Now, the question must be asked: Could her retirement at the age of 80 in then President Obama’s second term have deterred America’s now inevitable backslide into a neo-Dark Ages where the freedom to control one’s life and destiny no longer exists for those dwelling outside the womb? In that alternate future, the court would still have a conservative majority now but a narrower 5-4 split that would have at least given a semblance of hope. Ginsburg alone couldn’t have saved the court, but in giving up her seat she could have stalled its transformation into the conservative juggernaut that is about to achieve the Republicans’ Holy Grail. Then-President Trump was able to seat three justices in a single term thanks to the diabolical strategic maneuvering of the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who aided and abetted Trump in the hijacking of the courts, and with them our democracy. When the calls for Justice Ginsburg to retire began, many, including myself, derided the suggestions as anti-feminist at best and outright misogynist at worst. Do we ever ask men of a certain age to retire? No, we admire them as elder statesmen and applaud their ability to cheat death until the very end. Women, of course, are never afforded such applause. America’s longstanding allegiance to patriarchy aside, there was indeed a shrewd calculus that needed to be made when taking the temperature of the country and the moves that Republicans were making in the Obama years. No one could have foreseen Senator Mitch McConnell hijacking a Supreme Court seat without any real pushback from Democrats; people should have thought a lot harder about the lengths Republicans would go to given their announcement in Obama’s first term to make him a one term president. If you only get one bite at the apple, you better make it big—and this is what Democrats failed to do. Like the late Justice Ginsburg, Democrats of a certain time believed in honor and tradition. They believe in a shared moral fabric that for 240 years we have draped our imperfect union in. Republicans, however, have shown they have only one allegiance and that is to power. And while they will fight to the end for that power, Democrats have all too often given in. When Ginsburg made her decision to stave off retirement it was up to Democrats to do what they could to protect the court from the unrelenting assault Republicans have been waging for decades. What would that have meant? Not rolling over and allowing Mitch McConnell to hold Merrick Garland’s seat hostage and certainly not allowing him to do so again by ignoring the request of Justice Ginsburg from her deathbed to not let Trump replace her. Should it have been up to Ginsburg, the second woman ever named to the Supreme Court, to make her own decision about whether or not to retire? Yes. It was her choice and she earned it. Ginsburg was a fighter for every marginalized group—one who lamented how the decision was constructed in Roe v. Wade because she felt that abortion shouldn’t be couched in the right to privacy of a pregnant woman but rather in gender equity under the 14th Amendment equal protection clause. How can women and pregnant people be deemed as equal under the law without actualizing their bodily autonomy? Maybe 50 years from now, if the nation still stands, another case will be brought to restore the right that more than half of the population of this “free” nation just lost."

Raskin is a prominent Democrat on the committee and also led the House efforts when Trump was impeached for a historic second time, in 2021, accused of inciting the storming of the US Capitol by his extremist supporters who were trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “This was a coup organized by the president against the vice-president and against the Congress in order to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said in an interview with the Guardian, Reuters news agency and the Climate One radio program. Public hearings by the bipartisan special committee investigating January 6 and related actions by Trump and his White House team and other allies, chaired by the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, are expected next month. “We’re going to tell the whole story of everything that happened. There was a violent insurrection and an attempted coup and we were saved by Mike Pence’s refusal to go along with that plan,” said Raskin. He was referring to Trump’s vice-president, who went ahead in his role of overseeing the certification of Biden’s win, which was delayed until the early hours of the following day after Pence and other lawmakers, staff and journalists ended up running for their lives as rioters stormed the building, shortly after Trump held a rally near the White House exhorting his supporters to “fight like hell”. Bennie Thompson, Liz Cheney and Jamie Raskin, key members of the House Capitol attack panel. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP The November 2020 presidential election was deemed by experts at the local, state and federal level to have been “the most secure” in American history, with Trump’s attorney general, Bill Barr, also concluding that December that the result was accurate. Raskin told the Guardian, however, that the panel’s hearings would demonstrate to the American public the actions Trump, and the cohort who went along with his efforts, took to overturn the election result. If the attack on the Capitol had succeeded in preventing the certification of Biden as the incoming president, Raskin asserted that “Trump was prepared to seize the presidency and likely to invoke the Insurrection Act and declare martial law”. The insurrection resulted in death and injury to law enforcement and Raskin said that in addition to Pence’s stance against Trump’s demands, the democratic process that day was also saved by “the valor and the bravery of our officers who stood strong against the attempt to just overrun the whole process”. After a broad criminal investigation, about 800 people have been charged with crimes committed in relation to the Capitol attack. Raskin said: “We don’t have a lot of experience with coups in our own country and we think of a coup as something that takes place against a president.” However, January 6 was not what is typically regarded as a coup because it did not involve the military or another faction in society attacking the head of the government. “It’s what the political scientists call a self-coup … It’s a president fearful of defeat, overthrowing the constitutional process,” Raskin said. The Maryland congressman is also looking at the bigger, interrelated picture of American democracy and the climate crisis. “We’ve got to save the democracy in order to save the climate and save our species,” he told the Guardian, Reuters and Climate One in the interview, as part of the Covering Climate Now media collaboration. Extremist groups were part of the insurrection and have been an outsize, renewed influence on political and social division in the US in recent years. Raskin said: “We’re never going to be able to successfully deal with climate change if we’re spending all our time fighting the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers and Ku Klux Klan, and the Aryan nations and all of Steve Bannon’s alt-right nonsense.”"

Madison Cawthorn gave cousin $141K in campaign and taxpayer funds, records show","RALEIGH, N.C. — A relative and close adviser to U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn has pocketed more than $141,000 from taxpayers and campaign donors since 2020, according to congressional and campaign payroll records. The documents also show a roughly eight-month period during which the 26-year-old North Carolina congressman paid Stephen Smith, his second cousin, simultaneously from Cawthorn’s congressional office and campaign. The payments were addressed to Smith at a Hendersonville address. The address matches that of Cawthorn's, state voter registration records show. U.S. House members are prohibited from hiring immediate family members, such as first cousins. But the requirement doesn’t extend to second cousins. Nonetheless, the payments sharpen the focus on the nature of the relationship between Cawthorn and Smith and raise questions from political observers about the perception of family self-dealing. Luke Ball, a spokesman for Cawthorn, didn’t respond to questions about the congressman's relationship with Smith. Early Saturday, Cawthorn on Twitter said the media ""attacked my scheduler for making a salary"" and accused reporters of trying ""to annihilate my political career."" Smith was listed as a congressional office scheduler to Cawthorn and received $32,744 between Jan. 4, 2021, and Aug. 22, 2021, according to quarterly statements of disbursements published by the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer of the U.S. House. Smith wasn’t listed under Cawthorn’s office personnel section in the final months of 2021. Instead, he served as an ""ADA aide,"" a reference to the Americans with Disabilities Act. Between Aug. 1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2021, Smith earned $28,487 from the new position. Records for the first three months of 2022 haven’t been published. Cawthorn, who was left partially paralyzed after a car accident and now uses a wheelchair, has been assisted by Smith on the campaign trail. Smith has helped Cawthorn stand up on stages at events, including an April 9 political rally in Johnston County. “My cousin Stephen that they’re attacking is my ADA,” Cawthorn said of Smith in a Wednesday video. “He’s family and he’s my best friend.” Other filings show Smith has also received more than $80,000 from Cawthorn’s campaign since January 2020, which excludes more than $4,000 in other compensation for campaign supplies and travel reimbursements. While taking in more than $61,000 from U.S. taxpayers for his congressional work, Smith also received $16,669 as a campaign salary over the eight-month stretch. Certain chamber rules restrict how congressional employees interact with an incumbent’s campaign operations. For instance, congressional staff members are allowed to work on campaigns as long as they do so outside their regular working hours. Kedric Payne, vice president of the nonpartisan watchdog Campaign Legal Center, said Cawthorn’s decision to hire a family member is unusual but doesn’t constitute a clear violation of federal law. “A second cousin is not going to be covered under any nepotism rule, so, in this situation, nepotism would be a hard issue to be concerned with,” said Payne, who previously investigated ethics complaints as deputy chief counsel for the Office of Congressional Ethics. There are limits to how much outside money a senior staff member could receive beyond their congressional work, but because Smith was among the lowest paid on Cawthorn’s staff as a scheduler, Payne said Smith wouldn’t be subject to outside earned income limits. The hiring of a family member to a congressional office could raise eyebrows over Smith’s qualifications. “It’s not that common to have close relatives on your payroll,” Payne said. William Hall, a Webster University political scientist who previously worked for the U.S. Department of Justice and former Republican U.S. Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, said it would be up to voters to decide whether Cawthorn’s actions are disqualifying. “The people have the opportunity to make a determination of what is considered appropriate,” Hall said. Cawthorn faces ethics complaint Cawthorn, who is running for reelection, was elected to the U.S. House after turning 25, the minimum age required to hold office. In 2020, he campaigned for the seat of outgoing U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, who decided to leave western North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District seat to become former President Donald Trump’s chief of staff. A political newcomer, Cawthorn defeated 11 Republican primary competitors and handily won a June 2020 primary runoff election against real estate agent Lynda Bennett, who had the backing of Meadows and Trump. Cawthorn went on to defeat his Democratic general election opponent, Moe Davis, and has since aligned himself closely with the former president. Cawthorn is now seeking reelection in the district, where he faces seven primary challengers, including state Sen. Chuck Edwards and local GOP official Michele Woodhouse. Cawthorn has alienated former allies and supporters while also further turning off those who had already disliked him. Meanwhile, a political action group with the objective of unseating Cawthorn, has ramped up its attacks, releasing potentially damaging private videos of Cawthorn in recent weeks. The American Muckrakers PAC, a political group that runs the Fire Madison website, said it had filed an ethics complaint against Cawthorn last week asking investigators to look into Cawthorn’s relationship with Smith. The Office of Congressional Ethics declined to comment on whether it is examining the political group’s complaint. “In adherence to the rules that govern our office, I’m unable to provide any sort of comment,” said an email from Bill Beaman, a spokesperson for the office. Among the group’s exhibits in the complaint were sexual references made in messages tied to peer-to-peer payment app transactions between the two. The complaint also included a video showing Smith placing his hand on Cawthorn’s crotch. The video was first published by The Daily Mail. In a seven-minute video response Wednesday, Cawthorn called the video “stupid locker room talk between two cousins that grew up like brothers taken long before I served in Congress.” After Cawthorn’s response video was posted on his social media channels, American Muckrakers published a graphic video of Cawthorn naked and simulating a sex act near someone he describes as a friend. Cawthorn swiftly confirmed the video’s authenticity, labeling it as “blackmail.” “Years ago, in this video, I was being crass with a friend, trying to be funny,” he said on Twitter. “We were acting foolish, and joking. That’s it.” Cawthorn’s campaign declined to identify the person in the video. Cawthorn losing sway with GOP leaders Cawthorn has become a national figure during his short time in Congress, garnering the backing of Trump and positioning himself as an anti-establishment candidate. Cawthorn spoke at a rally for Trump shortly before a mob broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Cawthorn is now facing a ballot challenge, with a group of voters arguing he shouldn’t be allowed to run due to his alleged involvement in the walkup to the insurrection. Cawthorn has denied wrongdoing and sought to prevent state elections officials from considering the request that he be taken off the ballot. Cawthorn drew the ire of state lawmakers last year after announcing he’d run outside his home district to pursue a more politically favorable area outside of Charlotte. The move was viewed by political observers as an effort to stifle a bid from state House Speaker Tim Moore. North Carolina law doesn’t prohibit U.S. House candidates from running outside the district where they reside. A redrawn congressional map prompted Cawthorn to return his campaign to his home district, which represents Asheville and extends to Cherokee County. Since announcing his move back to the 11th Congressional District on Feb. 28, the congressman has faced a relentless string of outside attacks over his comments and actions. Cawthorn was cited for bringing a loaded gun to an airport for the second time in little more than a year and has faced allegations of potentially unlawful overpayments to Blake Harp, his chief of staff. The Daily Beast on Thursday reported the alleged overpayments, with Harp accused of surpassing outside income limits for senior staff members through his business, EMP Strategies. Harp didn’t respond to a request for comment. Cawthorn in a Saturday tweet defended himself, Smith and Harp, writing, ""We’re all in our 20s. Trying to make a difference in politics. And we’ll keep fighting.” Allies distance themselves from NC's Madison Cawthorn, ex-supporters seek to oust him One of Cawthorn’s closest allies, Triangle-area congressional candidate Bo Hines—who has paid more than $9,000 to Harp’s business, according to campaign finance records—has sought to distance himself from Cawthorn. Top Republicans have also created distance, especially after Cawthorn in March called Ukraine’s president a “thug” and alleged that Republican colleagues invited him to sex parties. Cawthorn walked back his claims during a tense meeting with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, McCarthy told reporters in March. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis and the state’s top two Republican state lawmakers, Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, support Edwards, who is widely viewed as Cawthorn’s top primary opponent."

Marjorie Taylor Greene off the ballot for her role in inciting the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol are asking a judge to consider a newly released text message she wrote about former President Donald Trump declaring “Marshall” law to remain in office. Backed by the group Free Speech for People, four residents of the first-term Republican’s district are asking an administrative law judge to rule her ineligible for reelection because the 14th Amendment prohibits insurrectionists from holding office. “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall [sic] law,” Greene wrote in the Jan. 17, 2021, message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, apparently misspelling the term “martial law.” “I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him,” her text message continued. “They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” The text was among 2,300 messages that Meadows turned over to the House committee investigating the Capitol riot that were subsequently released to CNN on Monday. They detail the various ways Meadows was helping Trump overturn his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Greene testified for three hours last week at a hearing in Atlanta where she repeated Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen through massive voter fraud. She denied having advocated violence, despite social media video evidence to the contrary, and said she did not “recall” having pushed for martial law. In a court filing Wednesday, lawyers wrote that the new text message undermined Greene’s credibility. “Greene’s testimony at the hearing that she could not remember discussing martial law with anyone was already dubious. This text with President Trump’s Chief of Staff makes her testimony even more incredible because it seems like the kind of message with the kind of recipient that a reasonable person testifying truthfully would remember,” the lawyers wrote. “Eleven days after the failed insurrection, Greene was still fighting against the peaceful transfer of power by advocating extra-legal means. This text, like her statements on January 5, shows the lengths to which she was willing to go to help Mr. Trump remain in power,” they added. Greene’s lawyer, James Bopp, said the new text doesn’t prove anything and actually shows that Green was distancing herself from the idea of martial law. “It’s not related at all to the case. It’s completely innocuous,” he said. The Georgia Republican is among a handful of members of Congress that Free Speech for People is trying to have removed from election ballots, a strategy the group intends to deploy against Trump, should he run in 2024 to get his old office back. A section of the 14th Amendment states that no one who has previously sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution but who then takes part in an insurrection can subsequently hold office. The judge in the case, Charles Beaudrot, is likely to rule next week. The Georgia primary election, in which Greene faces opposition, will be held May 24. Despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, Trump became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol — his last-ditch attempt to remain in office ― killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and preceded four police suicides. Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024."

Wade, according to legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg of NPR. Totenberg said on ABC’s “This Week” that the prevailing theory is that a conservative clerk released the decision in an attempt to lock in the five justices who voted to support overturning Roe as Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly attempts to pull his colleagues toward a more moderate position. “That has never, ever occurred before,” Totenberg said of the leak. “That could only, in all likelihood, have come from a justice — that I think is less likely — or perhaps one of the clerks.” “The only one that makes sense is it came from somebody who was afraid that this majority might not hold,” she added. Politico leaked Alito’s draft opinion on Monday, spurring protests across the nation as liberals raised fears of abortion rights being overturned for the first time since 1973. Roberts condemned the leak and ordered an investigation into who was behind the move, which he called “a singular and egregious breach” of trust. Republicans have decried the leak as an injustice and suggested it is a political attack from an outraged liberal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called it a “stunning breach” and “an attack on the independence of the Supreme Court.” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) on Sunday theorized on Fox News that the leak was “almost certainly one of the 12 law clerks that are clerking for the three liberal justices” “I’m confident we don’t have a master criminal working at the court. I think there are going to be electronic records,” Cruz said on “Sunday Morning Futures.” Experts told The Hill they are divided on whether it was a liberal or conservative law clerk, each of whom could have had their own motives. But nearly everyone has agreed a sitting Supreme Court justice would not leak the draft opinion."
/r/politics/comments/ulom18/column_why_we_need_term_limits_for_supreme_court/,1652093937,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-04/column-supreme-court-term-limit,36631,Column: Why we need term limits for Supreme Court justices,"The Supreme Court’s now-confirmed intention of overturning the half-century-old protection for abortion rights in Roe vs. Wade is energizing the debate over how to rein in the court’s extreme conservative slant. Expanding the court beyond its current complement of nine justices has long been the most widely discussed option. Another idea may be gaining traction, however: eliminating the justices’ right to lifetime appointment by imposing a term limit. This option, which has been discussed for decades, received its most recent airing in March at a roundtable among law professors sponsored by Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas School of Law. “It is telling that all of us seem to be fully comfortable with the idea of term limits,” Levinson wrote after the event. “It is getting harder and harder to find anyone who genuinely defends either as ‘necessary’ or even ‘proper’ the truly exceptional national American practice of ‘full-life’ tenure that allowed John Paul Stevens to serve for 34 years until he turned 90.” Levinson is correct. The Founding Fathers almost certainly did not expect Supreme Court justices to serve that long, and for most of American history they didn’t. The average tenure on the court was 15 years until the 1970s, when it shot up to nearly 26 years. By 2005, the average age of justices at death or resignation was nearly 79, a record. “Life tenure today means a significantly longer tenure than it meant in 1789,” Steven G. Calabresi and James Lindgren of Northwestern University observed in 2015. The average has plainly risen since then — Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in office at 87, Antonin Scalia at 79. Stephen Breyer retired this year at 83 and Anthony Kennedy in 2018 at 82. The trend is an artifact of improved healthcare. The average age of Supreme Court justices at the time of their appointment has remained stable since the late 1700s at about 50 to 55, but life expectancy since then has soared. Life tenure for judges doesn’t only make the U.S. an outlier globally, Levinson wrote, but sets the federal government apart from the states, only one of which (Rhode Island) grants its supreme court judges life tenure. In all other states, the high judges either have fixed terms or are required to step down at age 70. Pros and cons exist for both options for reshaping the court. Term limits appear to be more popular than expanding the court: Among respondents to a Morning Consult/Politico poll, 66% favored term limits for justices versus 21% against them, while only 45% favored expanding the court versus 36% against. The poll was taken after the leaked disclosure Monday of a draft opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. that would overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion rights nationwide. On the negative side, imposing a term limit on the justices may be legally more difficult than expanding the court. The constitutionality of subjecting Supreme Court justices to fixed terms via legislation rather than through a constitutional amendment is open to question, and the amendment process is inherently more complicated than congressional action. Changing the number of justices, on the other hand, unmistakably falls within congressional authority. Before delving into how to fix the Supreme Court, let’s examine how it’s broken. It has become clear in recent years that the court has moved well to the right of American political sentiment. Legal experts Nancy Gertner and Lawrence Tribe, who were members of a commission established by President Biden to weigh options, wrote last year that “the anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian direction of this court’s decisions about matters such as voting rights, gerrymandering and the corrupting effects of dark money” made reshaping the court imperative. (They favored expanding the court “as soon as possible.”) A gulf plainly exists between what appears to be a court majority restricting abortion rights and public opinion, which overwhelmingly favors access to abortion in some or all circumstances. Only 20% of Americans think abortion should be banned entirely. The reasons for the divergence of public opinion and court actions aren’t hard to find. One is the increasing politicization of the appointment process, in which a justice is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. As has been pointed out by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional scholar and dean of the law school at UC Berkeley, from 1960 through 2021, Republicans held the White House for 32 years and Democrats for 29, almost an even split. But in that period Republicans have appointed 15 justices and Democrats only nine. That count includes conservatives Neil Gorsuch, who was the beneficiary of the Senate GOP’s dishonest maneuvering to withhold consideration of Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to succeed the late Antonin Scalia, and Amy Coney Barrett, whose nomination was rushed through to confirmation to give Trump instead of Biden the opportunity to appoint a successor to Ginsburg. It also includes Ketanji Brown Jackson, appointed by Biden. Life terms for the Supreme Court have led to this uneven distribution of appointments. To some extent this is the luck of the draw. Following the 12-year tenure of Franklin Roosevelt, who appointed eight justices, Democratic presidents were consistently shortchanged — Democrats Bill Clinton and Obama got only two appointments each during their eight White House years and Jimmy Carter none, while Republican George H.W. Bush got two in his sole term and Trump three in his sole term. No Democratic president was able to appoint a justice in the 26 years between Lyndon B. Johnson’s appointment of Thurgood Marshall in 1967 and Clinton’s of Ginsburg in 1993. The prospect of open-ended service on the court encouraged justices themselves to try gaming their retirements. Typically they tried to hang on until they could be assured that a like-minded president would appoint their successor (not that this invariably worked). The result was the continued service of justices who were plainly impaired mentally or physically. That has prompted concerns about what legal scholar David J. Garrow labeled “mental decrepitude” on the court. The best known example for Supreme Court aficionados is probably that of William O. Douglas, whose 1974 stroke left him so debilitated that his colleagues on the bench secretly agreed to hold over any cases on which Douglas would cast the deciding vote to break a 4-4 tie. Douglas retired in 1975 and died in 1980, at age 81. (As a personal aside, Douglas gave the keynote address at my college commencement the year before his stroke, and he was already incoherent.) The dangers of open-ended Supreme Court terms are illustrated by the case of Ginsburg, a liberal icon who hung on through repeated bouts of cancer until she died in 2020 at age 87, long past the point when her retirement would have allowed Democrat Obama to name her successor. “Some of us remain truly angry,” Levinson wrote, that Ginsburg “chose to roll the dice with the country’s future for no good reason other than her own vanity.” That brings us back to the question of a term limit for Supreme Court justices. The most common version of this proposal is for a term limit of 18 years, combined with a permanent fixing of the court’s size at nine. The goal would be to provide an opening on the bench every two years, or two in every presidential term. Fixed terms for justices would offer at least three virtues. It would help make the Supreme Court more reflective of contemporary political mores — justices in their 50s and 60s would surely be more attuned to the ebb and flow of social movements than those in their 80s. It would reduce the political stakes for any nomination, because the prospect of using an appointment to affect the partisan tilt of the court into the limitless future would vanish. It would also reduce the likelihood that political extremism would take hold of the court. At the Levinson roundtable, Lori A. Ringhand of the University of Georgia estimated that had the 18-year rule been in effect starting with Bill Clinton’s term in 1993, the court would comprise “four strongly liberal justices, three strongly conservative justices, a moderately conservative justice, and a moderately liberal justice” rather than today’s 6-3 conservative majority. “A court so comprised might well find common ground on many issues,” Ringhand speculated. “More fundamentally, it almost certainly would better represent the constitutional preferences of the American people.” To those who might object that this system would pare away extreme liberal as well as extreme conservative leanings, one can merely reply: If only. For most of American history, and particularly recent history, the court has been a bulwark of conservatism. The liberalism of the Earl Warren court of the 1950s and ’60s was an aberration, its image as a beacon of progressivism derived from two major factors — the presence among its members of long-serving liberal lions Hugo Black, William J. Brennan and Douglas, as well as its landmark 1954 anti-segregation ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education. The remaining question is whether a Supreme Court term limit is constitutional. The best one can say is that expert opinion is divided. The governing language in the Constitution is the “behavior clause,” which specifies that federal judges at all levels “shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour.” Some experts say that’s the sole condition placed on the term of justices, which means that change would require a constitutional amendment — proposed by a two-thirds vote of both houses and ratified by three-fourths of the states — obviously a politically fraught and time-consuming process. But some say the Constitution’s drafters designed the clause only to guarantee that judges would be immune to pressure from the executive and legislative branches, not that no other conditions could be placed on their terms of service. Some also assert that even if the clause mandates lifetime service, that requirement can be met by limiting judges to 18 years on the Supreme Court bench and transferring them to appellate or district courts after that, while guaranteeing a lifetime salary. No one ever said restructuring the Supreme Court would be easy. FDR learned that from the failure of his court-packing scheme, which aimed to produce and solidify a liberal bench, but which almost brought the entire New Deal to a screeching halt. But with this court now poised for overtly partisan purposes to scrap a legal principle that has protected women’s reproductive rights for more than a half-century, the effort is necessary and urgent. No change could be implemented without a delay of several years at least. But with the abortion ruling now dominating political debate in America, the time to start is now."

Following Politico’s blockbuster scoop last week of the Supreme Court’s draft decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, people took to the streets. Pro-choice protests sprung up all across the country over the weekend, from DC to Baltimore to Oakland. But what has gotten folks most riled up is that the protesters took their outrage straight to the source: the steps of Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s and Chief Justice John Roberts’ houses. Footage from various news outlets show that protesters, armed with raincoats and homemade signs with snappy, pro-choice slogans, gathered outside of the judges’ home to exercise their freedom of speech and assembly. While their anger and frustration were palpable, the protests were far from violent. Yet by the way some people have described the demonstrations outside Kavanaugh’s home, you would’ve sworn that the protesters ripped him and his family out of their beds and executed them in the middle of the street. (Spoiler alert: They didn’t.) In a 13-second clip by Daily Signal news producer David Blair, you can see dozens of people standing outside of Kavanaugh’s house. They’re chanting, “We will not go back,” presumably to a time before abortions were safe and accessible. According to Blair, this was “one of the scariest things I’ve ever witnessed.” “This is an attempt at intimidation,” said Blair in an interview with Fox News, apparently clueless to the decades-long history of violent anti-abortion protests outside of clinics across America. “And I think it really says a lot, too, that the Biden administration is willing to absolutely let these justices out to dry. They’re not going to say, ‘It’s not acceptable for you to go to somebody’s house and yell and scream.’” But Blair underestimated the power of milquetoast white liberalism. At 9 a.m. this morning, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted the following in response to the demonstration: Everyone from the far-right to the center-left seems to be way more concerned about the optics of the protests than the systemic injustices that people are protesting against. We saw something eerily similar with the racial-justice protests in response to the death of George Floyd in 2020. Remember Tucker Carlson describing the Black Lives Matter protesters as a “mob,” warning his viewers that the protesters will “come for them”? Or Eric Trump describing them as “animals” during one of his father’s campaign rallies? (And despite only 3.7 percent of protests containing violence or vandalism, several Democrats, including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, stepped forward to condemn the violence at the demonstrations) Asking for civility in the face of systemic violence is playing right into the oppressors’ hand. If we spend all of our time policing how people protest, then, conveniently, nothing will get done to attack the root of the issue. It’s nothing more than an attempt to derail the public conversation surrounding reproductive rights. According to experts, if the courts overturn Roe, people’s lives will be at risk. Miscarriages could be criminalized. Abortion providers could be sued. But above all, people would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies. This clearly is a sacrifice that the Supreme Court’s conservative justices are willing to make. And if a Supreme Court justice losing a few hours of sleep seems worse to you than people dying from the complications of an unwanted pregnancy, it’s time to reevaluate your priorities. And to Kavanaugh, Roberts, and any other justices in favor of taking away people’s rights, if you can’t take the heat, stay out of people’s uteruses."

Wade. “The Republicans say ‘oh we’re going to replace and reform.’ They haven’t done anything,” Scarborough said on his show, “Morning Joe.” “The fact is, they do support the death penalty, that is one thing they support. But more and more this seems to be a party that really believes that life begins at conception but ends at childbirth.” The host blasted the GOP for messaging pledging support for the rights of an unborn child, “but the second they’re born, they’re on their own,” he said. “This is not a party that gives a damn about those babies who are actually born and what happens to them after they are born,” Scarborough continued. “It’s so hypocritical.” Several GOP senators and governors have cheered news of the draft opinion from the court, which currently has a conservative majority. Democrats on Capitol Hill have accused several conservative justices of misleading lawmakers and the public about their views on the landmark decision granting the right to an abortion. Leading Republicans and conservative media figures have spent the last several days fixated on the fact the draft opinion was leaked, suggesting it was done by a liberal inside the court with the goal of intimidating the justices or changing votes on the issue. On Wednesday, Mika Brzezinski, Scarborough’s co-host and wife, attacked Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for his comments this week suggesting the “story of the day” is the leak instead of the content of the draft opinion."

A group of five voters from Ms Greene's district is suing the congresswoman, alleging that she is ineligible to run for federal office under the 14th Amendment. The group claims she ""voluntarily aided and engaged"" in the Capitol riot insurrection, which should invalidate her ability to hold federal office under the 14th Amendment. That amendment was ratified after the Civil War to prevent Confederate officers and officials from holding public office in the US. ""It's absurd what they are claiming and lying about,"" Ms Greene said. ""They're going to allow the press in the courtroom. They're going to allow the whole thing to be videoed live out to go anywhere in the world that they want to. And you know what that's going to look like — the Democrats and the nasty mainstream media, you know, the ones that lie about me constantly anyways, well, they're going to be able to twist and turn, and clip out any little piece they want of the horrible things that these funded attorneys are going to try to say about me."" Attorneys can request that the public – which includes the press – be barred from a courtroom if they can present reasonable evidence to suggest that such access would hinder a defendant's right to a fair trial. Court rooms are also closed during trials to protect juveniles or, in some cases, to protect the privacy of witnesses, jurors, or victims. Unfortunately for Ms Greene, a defendant trying to avoid the press publishing critical information is not by itself a qualifying justification for closing a court. Ms Greene tried to stop the trial by asking for an injunction and a temporary restraining order. However, Judge Amy Totenberg of the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia rejected her request. The judge said Ms Greene failed to demonstrate that she had a substantial likelihood of succeeding in the case. The group suing Ms Greene is represented by a group called Free Speech for People. That group also launched a similar challenge aimed at Republican Congressman Madison Cawthorne, but a judge blocked that lawsuit from proceeding. If Ms Greene is found to be in violation of the 14th Amendment, her name will either be stricken from the ballot or – if the ballots are already printed – voters will be advised that she is disqualified and any voters for her will be discarded."

Then he added: “And for the Secret Service, if they’re listening, I’m not advocating we kill Anthony Fauci … until he’s convicted of his crimes through a court.” Fauci, as a highly visible U.S. health official, has spoken about the barrage of conservative criticism, vitriol and violent threats he’s received for his public health advice during the pandemic. He called for the firing of Fox News’ Jesse Watters after the TV host in December urged young conservatives to “ambush” him and “go for the kill shot” with questions. “The only thing that I have ever done throughout these two years is to encourage people to practice good public health practices: to get vaccinated, to be careful in public settings, to wear a mask,” Fauci said at the time."

Another book that contains details it would have been nice to know at the time, before all hell broke loose on Capitol Hill. From CNN: If Trump could successfully pressure Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to de-certify Biden’s narrow win in Georgia, that would lead to a domino effect: Officials in Pennsylvania and Michigan would follow suit and overturn Biden’s electoral victory, Trump believed, a stunning reversal that could keep him in the White House for a second term. And Trump was certain he could subvert the election outcome, telling McConnell, then the Senate majority leader, and other top Republicans that he had personally been on the phone with officials in Pennsylvania and Michigan – and they told him they would move to keep him in power, despite the results showing Biden had won their states. “I’ve been calling folks in those states and they’re with us,” Trump is reported to have told the Senate GOP leaders in a private December 2020 phone call, according to a soon-to-be-released book by New York Times political reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, both CNN political analysts. December? Weeks before the shitstorm, and “Senate leaders” already heard it from the horse’s…ah…mouth that the steal was underway. Did any of them warn anybody? The Capitol Police? The Pentagon? The FBI? DC police? God forbid they should tip off the Democrats. Mitch McConnell had better things to do. An excerpt of the book, provided to CNN, also underscores the difficult political spot in which Trump’s conspiracies left McConnell, who was hoping to shift the focus away from the 2020 election and instead put the weight of the party behind the races for two Senate seats in Georgia, both of which were headed to January 2021 runoffs and would determine the next Senate majority. McConnell maintained a strategic silence over Trump’s lies in an attempt to prevent him from sabotaging the GOP’s chances ahead of the runoffs, the book said. “We’ve got to stay focused on Georgia,” McConnell said to his colleagues right after they got off the phone with Trump in December 2020. God, you can fck right off, you unpatriotic chelonian hack. Mitch McConnell believes in only two things—his power, and the money it can bring in. He doesn’t give a tortoise’s dick for his country or its institutions. At least Jefferson Davis had the class to give up his Senate seat before he helped endanger the republic. They all knew, every scurvy one of them. Put them all under oath, and lock up anyone who ignores a summons. Let justice be done, though the gravy trains fall."

On Dec. 29, the beleaguered North Carolina congressman posed at a party with James Koutoulas, a hedge fund manager and the ringleader of the Let’s Go Brandon cryptocurrency, a meme coin set up in the wake of the chant mocking President Joe Biden. “LGB legends. … Tomorrow we go to the moon!” Cawthorn, who has stated publicly he owns the cryptocurrency, posted on Instagram in response to the picture posted on Koutoulas’s Instagram page. The next day, LGBCoin did exactly as the lawmaker predicted. NASCAR driver Brandon Brown announced on Dec. 30 that the meme coin would be the primary sponsor of his 2022 season, causing LGBCoin’s value to spike by 75%. Brown’s statement featured comments from Koutoulas, who was pictured with Cawthorn just a few hours prior. Multiple watchdog groups told the Washington Examiner that Cawthorn’s Dec. 29 Instagram post suggests the lawmaker may have had advanced nonpublic knowledge of LGBCoin’s deal with Brown. The watchdogs said the post, combined with Cawthorn’s statement that he owns LGBCoin, warrants an investigation from the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine whether the lawmaker violated federal insider trading laws. “This looks really, really bad,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the government affairs manager for Project on Government Oversight, a federal watchdog group. “This does look like a classic case of you got some insider information and acting on that information. And that’s illegal.” “I think there’s probably a strong case here,” Hedtler-Gaudette added. “I don’t want to prejudge, but based on everything that’s out there, I think there is a very strong possibility that if someone is going to investigate this, they’re going to find something.” Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, said if Cawthorn purchased LGBCoin before Dec. 30 with nonpublic knowledge of the cryptocurrency’s pending deal with Brown, that would constitute insider trading, a federal crime that can involve prison time. Immediately following Brown’s Dec. 30 announcement, the value of all LGBCoin in circulation eclipsed $570 million. By the end of January, the market cap of the meme coin dropped to $0. Koutoulas said in a Feb. 20 livestream that two factors led to LGBCoin’s precipitous decline: First, NASCAR rejected LGBCoin’s sponsorship deal with Brown on Jan. 4, and then later that month, unidentified insiders that owned an outsize share of the coin dumped all their holdings at once, causing the coin’s market value to evaporate. The swift rise and fall of the meme coin led one jilted investor to file a class-action lawsuit in April accusing Koutoulas and other LGBCoin insiders of using the digital currency to orchestrate a pump-and-dump scheme. While Cawthorn isn’t named as a defendant in the class-action lawsuit, he is identified as one of the coin’s celebrity endorsers that helped Koutoulas inflate LGBCoin’s market value before the rug was pulled. Koutoulas relaunched LGBCoin in February, claiming the second iteration of the meme coin came with restrictions preventing “whales,” or people with significant holdings in the coin, from offloading all their coins at once. Since its relaunch in February, LGBCoin has traded around 95% below the peak price set in late December. Despite the poor performance of the meme coin, Cawthorn has continued to tour the nation with Koutoulas, promote his ownership of the coin, and urge his followers to purchase the asset. “I got Let’s Go Brandon coin,” Cawthorn said at the Conservative Political Action Conference, according to a video Koutoulas posted to his Instagram page in late February. “It’s working out well, very well.” Cawthorn promoted the coin again with Koutoulas in March during the American Freedom Tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “This is going to the moon, baby! To the moon!” Cawthorn said while pointing to an LGBCoin logo pinned to Koutoulas’s suit jacket. “Letsgobrandon.com — get on the train. Get on the train. Take the power of currency away from the government.” Also in March, Cawthorn appeared with Koutolulas at Freedom Fight Night in Miami. The two were pictured inside a UFC-like arena pointing at the LGBCoin logo. “The blood on the logo is from the guys that sold the dip,” Koutoulas said on Instagram. Cawthorn appeared at multiple events with Koutoulas before the meme coin spiked in late December. “Incredible spending back to back nights with the affable Patriot @CawthornforNC,” Koutoulas wrote in a Dec. 5 tweet with a picture of him posing with Cawthorn, who was holding a pin with the LGBCoin logo. Koutoulas has also signaled that Cawthorn owns LGBCoin. Both Koutoulas and the LGBCoin Twitter account retweeted a photo in early April that identified Cawthorn as a holder of the meme coin. Koutoulas also retweeted a message claiming the North Carolina lawmaker had “endorsed” the coin. And in his Feb. 20 livestream, Koutoulas claimed that unidentified members of Congress had purchased LGBCoin. “We’ve had several people who are on the America First platform, who are actually congressional candidates and/or current members of Congress that have bought with their own money, and I believe members have donated to [charities] with LGB,” Koutoulas said. Lawmakers are required to disclose if they purchase over $1,000 worth of any cryptocurrencies, but Cawthorn has not filed any disclosures indicating he owns LGBCoin. Koutoulas said in his Feb. 20 livestream that both iterations of LGBCoin were designed so that the meme coin was not classified as security for regulatory purposes. “It is not technically or legally possible for a decentralized meme coin that exists to promote free speech and charitable giving to be classified or treated as a security,” Koutoulas told the Washington Examiner. But Hedtler-Gaudette, the government affairs manager for POGO, said that even if LGBCoin isn’t considered a security, that won’t render Cawthorn immune from insider trading laws. “No matter what, though, having advance and nonpublic information that is then used to gain advantage in a financial market (including straight up commodities) is illegal, making my call for DOJ or SEC investigation still operative in this case,” Hedtler-Gaudette said. Holman, the Public Citizen government affairs lobbyist, added that Cawthorn would need to disclose if he purchased over $1,000 of the coin — even if it isn’t considered a security for regulatory purposes. Amid his public promotion of LGBCoin, Cawthorn used his authority as a lawmaker to introduce a resolution in the House in February that would “deregulate cryptocurrencies and incentivize blockchain innovation.” While Cawthorn’s proposed resolution lacked any specifics, Holman said Cawthorn could have run afoul of the STOCK Act if he introduced the measure for his own financial benefit. “Owning cryptocurrency would be an asset subject to disclosure of a lawmaker’s annual financial disclosure form,” Holman said. “It also could constitute a ‘personal benefit’ under the STOCK Act, making any official actions taken by Cawthorn to specifically and substantially benefit its value a violation of the STOCK Act.”"

Particularly in countries where it had never been done. In 2013, we pulled off Cambodia’s first televised debate that included the participation of the ruling Cambodia People’s Party (CPP) on a stage alongside the opposition. This was (and is) unheard of in the Cambodian political context where opposition leaders are more likely to be put in jail than given a microphone on mainstream media. The negotiation process with the government was painstaking, and I spent hours with the CPP party chair convincing him that a debate was advantageous. I tried every argument — the public should see their options and make an informed choice; it was an opportunity to showcase the CPP’s achievements; it gave space to counter opposition claims against them; it signals Cambodia’s democratic credentials. What ultimately worked? It looks weak to refuse a debate; it signals fear of losing and insecurity about your arguments. Last week, the Republic National Committee voted to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) and will require candidates to pledge they will not participate. My immediate thought was, what are they afraid of? Then a more discouraging realization seeped in — this is another sign the U.S. is moving backwards. The U.S. has supported candidate debates through our foreign aid as an important benchmark in democracy. Debates signal maturity, transparency, and competition. Sparring over policy differences and making a case to voters are signs of democratic advancement. And now the U.S. itself may not be able to meet that challenge. Everywhere I’ve worked, a key sticking point in debate organization is moderation. In weak and new democracies, the hangover of distrust is strong. There is no history of referees — neutral arbiters calling balls and strikes. One of the more difficult tasks for countries transitioning to democracy is building out independent bodies, whether an election management body, auditor general, anti-corruption commission, or ombudsperson. Media proves the most difficult, with journalists and outlets labeled partisan. Thus, the question of who will moderate a debate is fraught. I have had parties refuse to participate, rejecting every proposed moderator and insisting they would only join if they alone could choose. In Cambodia, finding a neutral moderator was difficult, but we managed to identify someone all parties could live with. One of the RNC’s complaints about debates is unfair and biased moderation selected by the CPD. The committee argues that moderation in 2020 gave Joe Biden an advantage. The CPD is actually nonpartisan, with a board of former Republican and Democratic leaders. Furthermore, selected moderators have included a diverse array of journalists, including from conservative-leaning outlet Fox News, such as Chris Wallace. No matter, as Donald Trump declared them all “against him” or “terrible and unfair.” As in the newer democracies where the U.S. provides aid, it appears we also are too polarized to agree upon neutral referees, and immaturely insistent that only our choices are the fair ones. Agreeing on debate rules is also a challenge. My experience has shown that candidates only like the rules applied to their opponent. In Thailand once, an incumbent mayor told me with a straight face that he should have more time to speak than his opponent because he had “more to say.” I’ve had multiple candidates argue that they should go last and reject the idea of a coin toss. In the country Georgia, the ruling party once made a list of specific people in the opposition they refused to debate at all, arguing that these politicians were too aggressive (though in private acknowledging that certain opposition candidates were simply “too good”). Not once in my experience, though, has a candidate failed to comply with time limits during a debate, as we have seen recently in the U.S. In 25 years, there was never a need for the moderator to say more than once “your time is up” or to switch off the microphone. Like elsewhere, the RNC is also complaining about debate rules, and the behavior they try to enforce. In 2020, the Trump campaign was furious that the commission determined that mics would be controlled in future debates to keep order because in the previous debate Trump refused to follow the time limits, constantly interrupted, and ignored the moderator. The Trump campaign also wanted control over the topics for debate, particularly when learning questioning would focus on his COVID response, though the campaigns had already agreed the issues for debate would be up to the moderators. The campaign also complained about live fact-checking by the moderator, accusing the commission of being  “stacked with Trump Haters and Never Trumpers.” Trump said the quiet part out loud: “As President, the debates are up to me… avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased Commission.” As I’ve experienced elsewhere, the Trump campaign had an inconsistent relationship with rules (he certainly wanted Biden’s speaking time limited), depending on to whom it applied, and a sense of entitlement. The RNC should consider carefully the company they are in — following the path of Putin, Orban, Mugabe, and other authoritarians. Refusing to debate is a trait of strongmen and dictators, not confident democrats. In a free society, as I have told parties everywhere, opting out of debates is not a good look. If the U.S. is unable to hold a presidential debate, it speaks volumes about the underlying health of our democracy. Neutrality exists nowhere. We cannot agree on rules, acceptable behavior, or even facts. Our chosen leaders are not mature enough to engage in civil discourse about policy and allow their opponents to finish a sentence. Few Americans will miss our presidential debates. The 2020 debates did not really inform anyone and disgusted people in the process, revealing nothing but rancor. We have already solidified our views, fallen into our tribes, and are unlikely to be persuaded by facts, argument, or reason. It is disheartening that Cambodia in 2013 managed what we cannot today. They were able to agree on debates, choose a moderator, follow the rules, and keep decorum. This latest threat to debates indicates that a contest of ideas on a level playing field, allowing voters to hear differing policy agendas, may be too elusive a goal for us today. We need to address the deeper democratic illness this reveals if we cannot meet the standard to which we hold others."

Three people were pardoned, and 75 received commutations of their sentences. It’s the first time Biden has exercised his constitutional clemency powers as president. Many of the people granted commutations were convicted years ago of crimes that today carry much lighter sentences. In a call with reporters Monday evening, White House officials said that if the people who received clemency were charged or convicted of any of the crimes in 2022, about a third of them would have received a lesser sentence. Two of the pardons went to people with low-level drug offenses, and the third was given to Abraham Bolden Sr., an 86-year-old former U.S. Secret Service agent and the first Black person to serve on a presidential detail. Bolden was accused of trying to sell a copy of a Secret Service file in 1964. Bolden maintained his innocence throughout his first trial, which resulted in a hung jury. Key witnesses against him in a second trial admitted they had lied at the prosecutor’s request, but Bolden was ultimately denied a new trial and spent several years in federal custody, White House officials said. Bolden maintained he was being punished because he exposed “unprofessional and racist” behavior within the Secret Service. He received a six-year sentence, which he finished in the late 1960s, according to the officials who gave details Monday on Biden’s actions. Betty Jo Bogans, 51, was pardoned for her conviction of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in Texas in 1998. Bogans was transporting drugs for her boyfriend and his accomplice, neither of whom were detained or arrested. Bogans received a seven-year sentence. Dexter Jackson, 52, of Georgia, was convicted in 2002 of using his business to aid in the facilitation of marijuana distribution. Though Jackson never distributed any drugs, he allowed marijuana dealers to use his pool hall to distribute the pot. Jackson pleaded guilty and served prison time; since his release from custody, he has operated a cellphone repair service and has hired high school students through a program that gives youths job opportunities, the White House officials said. Biden also announced an effort to support reentry into society after release from prison. This includes a new collaboration between the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor that will provide job training, grants for workforce development and capital for people starting businesses after being released from prison. There will also be opportunities to join the federal workforce, the White House officials said. The departments of justice and labor are investing $145 million over the 2022-2023 fiscal year to provide jobs and skill training to people seeking employment opportunities as they re-acclimate to life after incarceration. The initiative is a part of the First Step Act, signed by former President Donald Trump in 2020, and it’s the first time the Labor Department will begin working with prisoners, officials said. Biden described Tuesday’s actions as part of a “comprehensive strategy” to tackle the rise in gun violence and an uptick in homicides across the country’s major cities. “As I laid out in my comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime, helping those who served their time return to their families and become contributing members of their communities is one of the most effective ways to reduce recidivism and decrease crime,” Biden said in a statement. “While today’s announcement marks important progress, my Administration will continue to review clemency petitions and deliver reforms that advance equity and justice, provide second chances, and enhance the wellbeing and safety of all Americans.”"

Michael Foronda, Edward Foronda and Vivian Gorsky — three taxpayers who live near the Walt Disney World theme park and resort in Orlando — filed the lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday. Their filing says that they (and other taxpayers) “will now have to assume the tax burden that Disney previously assumed under the special tax status,” Courthouse News reported. Related: LGBTQ orgs & families sue Ron DeSantis to stop the “Don’t Say Gay” law Last month, DeSantis revoked Disney’s decades-old special zoning agreement that basically allowed Disney to self-govern the 39-square mile Reedy Creek Improvement District. The agreement allowed Disney to operate the district’s zoning laws and its municipal services, including its police and fire departments. Dissolving the special tax district means taxpayers will now have to pay the estimated $58 million annually required to provide those and other services. That will likely increase local property taxes between 20 to 25 percent. Additionally, Disney issued bonds with the state worth more than $1 billion. The dissolution of the district now means that the state is on the hook for the bond debt. Disney has reminded Florida of these costs, and the state has jeopardized its bond ratings because of its actions. A lowered bond rating would mean that Florida’s taxpayers will have to pay out more on the state government’s bonds. The plaintiffs’ lawsuit named DeSantis Florida Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee and Florida Department of Revenue Director Jim Zingale as defendants. DeSantis’ office has yet to comment on the lawsuit, but last week, his spokesperson Christina Pushaw — a woman who accused “Don’t Say Gay” critics of being pedophiles — said that Florida taxpayers wouldn’t have to pay for Disney’s dissolved special district. But she offered no specifics."
/r/politics/comments/u4vl7v/marjorie_taylor_greene_reports_her_first/,1650107549,https://www.thedailybeast.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-reports-her-first-fundraising-loss?ref=home,30398,Marjorie Taylor Greene Reports Her First Fundraising Loss,"The campaign committee for Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) reported on Friday its first net loss since she was elected, posting a $314,000 deficit over the first three months of 2022 while additionally revising previous contribution totals down by more than $100,000. About half of that loss is represented in fees to Donald Trump’s top Jan. 6 attorney and a security detail that protected Kyle Rittenhouse during his trial last year. While Greene has always traded steep fees for slightly higher returns, she’s always managed to come out on top—until now. Last quarter she sprung a hole in the bucket, as her campaign committee, Greene for Congress, spent about $1.38 million while taking in only $1.06 million in donations. Fundraising costs alone wiped out three-quarters of those receipts. Greene, one of the top fundraisers in the House, has deployed expensive digital fundraising operations in the past, and reports have dinged her for it, pointing out that the fees give the lie to an inflated small-dollar contribution stream. Last quarter, however, MAGAworld’s leading lady bet big on direct mail, sinking more than $400,000 into printing, postage, and associated expenses. When that money was added to consulting, list rental, and digital fees, Greene for Congress spent more than $735,000 on its fundraising efforts. To make matters worse, the same day the campaign filed its new report, it also filed three amended versions of previous reports from last year, admitting that the committee had overstated contributions by more than $100,000. The campaign currently holds about $3 million in cash on hand, which represents a net gain of about $900,000 over the last 12 months. Greene also spent big elsewhere this year, most specifically for personal security, racking up about $140,000 in expenses. Almost all of that went in three monthly payments to a Knoxville-based executive protection company called the KaJor Group, which also handled security for Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse during his trial last year. For Greene, who prior to the 2020 election had received protection free of charge from members of the Oath Keepers anti-government militia group, this is an extraordinary surge in security costs. Last year, it was mostly Democrats who took advantage of the Federal Election Commission’s post-insurrection ruling that elected officials can hire bodyguards with campaign funds. That year, Sens. Raphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, and Mark Kelly shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for personal protection, while Greene for Congress reported protective expenses just north of $12,000, nearly half of it for an electronic security system. That’s less than 10 percent of what she paid the Kajor Group last quarter. It’s not immediately clear why Greene hired the new firm. Asked about the expenses, which first appeared in late January, a campaign spokesperson told The Daily Beast, “I’m not going to get into details about her security due to the sensitive nature of it.” The spokesperson did, however, cite an uptick in threats to the congresswoman, including the arrest last month of a New York man who had made threatening calls to Greene’s D.C. office. “Our staff has reported over 20 threats to Capitol Police in the past week,” the spokesperson said in a text message, along with a link to Greene’s response to a controversial recent segment on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The spokesperson added that Greene also received “a significant amount” of threats in January, surrounding the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Ironically enough, many of Greene’s own colleagues blame that attack partially on her rhetoric, which they say empowers violent elements of the right wing. A few days after the Jan. 6 anniversary, Greene suggested using guns to defend against Democrats. “Ultimately, the truth is it’s our Second Amendment rights, our right to bear arms, that protects Americans and gives us the ability to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government,” Greene told right-wing talk host Seb Gorka on Jan. 11. “And I hate to use this language, but Democrats, they’re exactly… they’re doing exactly what our Founders talked about when they gave us the precious rights that we have.” Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist groups, told The Hill that those comments carry weight. “Some lawmakers are indeed a source of threats. Comments from figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene are regularly shared and converted into rallying cries for some segments of the far-right,” Katz said. Greene appears to have extended her ties to Jan. 6 in more ways than one. Three days after her Second Amendment remarks, the Greene campaign hired Trump legal adviser John Eastman, laying down a $10,000 retainer for his firm, the Constitutional Counsel Group, on Jan. 14. Eastman, a conservative legal scholar who devised the plan to subvert the Electoral College count, was at Trump’s side on Jan. 6, and remains a central focus of the congressional investigation into the events surrounding the insurrection. Greene currently faces a constitutional challenge to her candidacy for giving aid to Jan. 6 insurrectionists, and while a number of outside attorney applications remain under court seal, that lawsuit was filed in March, several weeks after Eastman was paid. Neither Greene nor her campaign appear in state court records in their home of Floyd County, GA. Asked why the campaign had hired Eastman, the campaign provided a statement suggesting that the matter involved constitutional concerns, but did not elaborate further. “Dr. Eastman is one of the leading constitutional attorneys in the country. When we need advice on significant constitutional issues, we have occasionally sought his counsel,” the statement said. “The particular issues for which we sought his advice are protected by attorney-client privilege, however.”"

""Mark Meadows has some explaining to do."" According to the paper, Meadows was registered in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina until he was removed from the latter's voter rolls as state officials investigate whether he fraudulently voted in the 2020 election. He is still registered to vote in Virginia and South Carolina. ""Crystal Mason got five years prison for inadvertently voting. Pam Moses got six years prison for registering to vote,"" tweeted human rights lawyer Qasim Rashid, referring to two Black women critics say were unfairly targeted for unwitting errors. On Friday, a Tennessee prosecutor dropped all charges against Moses. ""Why is Mark Meadows not in prison for deliberate voter fraud?"" Rashid asked. The government accountability watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) tweeted, ""Mark Meadows has some explaining to do."" Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) quipped that ""every GOP accusation is a confession."" Meadows frequently invoked the prospect of Democrat voter fraud--something experts say is exceedingly rare--during the 2020 campaign. In an August 2020 CNN interview he asked, ""Do you realize how inaccurate the voter rolls are, with people just moving around?"" ""Anytime you move, you'll change your driver's license, but you don't call up and say, 'Hey, by the way, I'm re-registering,'"" he added. Meadows played a key role in Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 presidential contest, pressuring federal and state officials to reverse or investigate election results based on conspiracy theories and the former president's baseless claims of fraud. After Trump left office, Meadows was hired as a senior partner at the Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI), a right-wing advocacy group claiming to promote ""election integrity."" According to the Post: The organization's ""citizen's guide"" urges activists to determine that the registrations of their neighbors are legal by checking on ""whether voters have moved, or if the registrations are P.O. boxes, commercial addresses, or vacant lots"" and then ""obtaining evidence: photos of commercial buildings? Vacant lots?"" and ""securing affidavits from current residents that a registered voter has moved""... Meadows, in fact, was the keynote speaker at a CPI Election Integrity Summit in Atlanta on February 19. ""What you're doing is investing in the future of our country and making sure only legal votes count,"" Meadows told attendees. He said he had just gotten off the phone with Trump, who he said had told him: ""We cannot give up on election integrity."" North Carolina investigators are focusing on whether Meadows voted by absentee ballot in 2020 using the address of a home that he neither owned nor lived in. The bipartisan U.S. House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol has also called on the Justice Department to criminally charge Meadows after he was found in contempt of Congress for failing to appear before the panel to testify about his role in the deadly insurrection."

The segment appears to be part of a recent settlement relating to a defamation lawsuit brought against the network by two such workers. The segment notes that an investigation by state officials into unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud made by ex-President Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani turned up nothing. “The results of this investigation indicate that Ruby Freeman and Wandrea ‘Shaye’ Moss did not engage in ballot fraud or criminal misconduct,” a narrator states. “A legal matter with this network and the two election workers has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties through a fair and reasonable settlement,” the voiceover adds. Freeman and her daughter, Moss, say they were harassed online and in person after baseless rumors began circulating online, due in part to content published by the conspiracy website The Gateway Pundit, which the pair also sued. Can’t get enough of this reporting? Subscribe to Confider, The Daily Beast’s media newsletter here. In January 2021, when Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to try to “find” votes to overturn the state’s election results, he mentioned Freeman’s name 18 times. Freeman was also visited by a publicist for Kanye West, who threatened her in an effort to extract a confession about committing election fraud. And if that weren’t enough, video of the pair doing their jobs was hyped up by Rudy Giuliani—and Sean Hannity—who falsely claimed that it showed “blatant, clear, obvious” fraud. While speaking to Georgia State House Republicans about the video during a Zoom meeting in December 2020, Giuliani at one point can be heard saying, “We should try to get this on Newsmax and OANN.” Freeman and Moss sued Giuliani as well, and that case is ongoing."

Wade, It Can Ban Interracial Marriage","“The GOP is going to overturn Roe v. Wade, and that’s only the beginning.” When I pitched a column with that headline last week to my editor, I didn’t anticipate we’d read an unprecedented leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that would explicitly overrule a woman’s right to abortion—something that’s been “settled precedent” for half a century. Well, here we are now, thanks to a fully radicalized right-wing movement engaged in a zero-sum absolutist game to attain minority rule for white Christian men by any means necessary. Next month, the Supreme Court will finally rule in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, regarding a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. A similar law was recently passed in Florida which was in part inspired by the Texas heartbeat bill that has spawned draconian copycat bills across the nation. If the court upholds the law, and overturns Roe and Planned Parenthood vs. Casey, which affirmed that the state is prohibited from banning most abortions, the ruling will allow its right-wing majority to zero in on marriage equality and the use of contraceptives, which will be next on the chopping block. By overturning Roe and Casey, America will join only three other backsliding democratic countries in the past 30 years to restrict a woman’s right to abortion. Meanwhile, 59 countries have expanded access. The opinion of four men and Justice Amy Coney Barrett will lead to a likely prohibition on abortion in 26 states. In Texas, for example, a doctor could go to prison for life if they perform an abortion on a woman who was raped by a family member. In the leaked draft opinion, Justice Alito justifies his ruling by claiming abortion isn’t an unenumerated right, and “the Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” Well, same-sex marriage and the right to contraception are also unenumerated rights. The draft opinion assures us that overturning Roe would have no such impact on these other rights. However, by the right-wing majority’s very own logic used to dismantle Roe, these unenumerated rights don’t have any protection. But, hey, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins trusts these justices, so we should too! Unlike many of my colleagues in the media industry, I take Republicans at their word. Like helpful James Bond villains, they’ve been telling us the plot all along, but many refuse to take them literally and seriously. During the confirmation hearing of Justice-designate Ketanji Brown Jackson, Republican senators gave us a sneak preview of their ambitious goals to strip away our hard-earned rights. Sen. John Cornyn attempted to make the case that Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized gay marriage, was faulty and an “edict” of the Supreme Court. He has an ally in Justice Alito. In a controversial 2020 speech at the Federalist Society, Alito whined that straight, religious families are apparently the real victims of marriage equality because people like Alito can no longer say, “that marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Until very recently, that’s what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it’s considered bigotry.” Meanwhile, Sen. Marsha Blackburn openly said she opposed Griswold v. Connecticut, a landmark 1965 decision that granted the right to privacy and paved the way for Roe. Specifically, it allowed married couples the right to buy and use contraceptives without government restrictions. Sen. Blackburn, of course, believes the decision was “constitutionally unsound.” She is joined by Sen. Mike Braun, who went a step further and said he would even be open to overturning Loving v. Virginia—which legalized interracial marriages nationwide. Braun, instead, wants to let the states decide the issue (because that has worked out so wonderfully in the past for Black people trying to live their lives without fear of violence, harassment, inequality, and discrimination). I wonder how Justice Clarence Thomas, who is married to Ginni Thomas, a white woman, would vote if such a challenge to Loving were brought before him? Maybe he’d take one for the team. If all of this seems outlandish, well, so was the idea of Roe being overturned. Currently, we have Republicans banning books across the country, and passing laws designed to intimidate educators for teaching about diversity and “divisive” topics. A grand undoing of civil rights by the right wing is now an all-too-possible reality, and we have to be prepared. Melissa Murray, a legal scholar and professor of law at NYU, agrees with me that Republicans will most likely focus on gay marriage and contraception after they’re done hollowing out Roe. “Courts are the weapon of the minority,” Murray told me last week, before Justice Alito’s majority opinion was leaked. “Republicans are trying to do in court what they can’t do in majoritarian politics.” Professor Murray said the dismantling of marriage equality could be a long-term project—by emphasizing First Amendment rights and religious freedoms to create religious accommodations and objections to same-sex marriage. For example, the conservative majority in 2018 ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple on the basis of a religious objection. Cases like this will allow the religious right to use the Supreme Court to chisel away at gay rights. “Once you narrow the space for same-sex couples to exercise their rights, once you normalize that they can’t expect equal treatment, then you’re on the road to normalizing different treatment,” Murray said, adding that it only takes about 10 to 20 years to entrench and mainstream such ideas. “Republicans complain about liberal judicial activism, until they obtain power and use the Court to invalidate the will of the majority.” Carlton Larson, a constitutional law professor from UC Davis King Hall School of Law, believes it’s possible that the Supreme Court could reverse Obergefell. “This Supreme Court is being far more aggressive on a number of issues than I had expected. Two years ago I felt quite confident that Obergefell would not be reversed. Now it’s at least possible,” Larson said, adding that there’s some reason for hope. “On balance, I still think rather unlikely, given the huge number of marriages that have been entered into in reliance on Obergefell, and the lack of any obvious harm to society as a result.” Still, Larson stresses that Obergefell was decided primarily as a substantive due process opinion, which allows courts to protect certain unenumerated fundamental rights from government interference. If the conservative majority of the court is determined to undo the entire line of substantive due process cases as illegitimate, then it might not only be Obergefell, but also Griswold and Eisenstadt v. Baird (which gave unmarried people the right to possess contraception), up for reversal. “I think reversing every single substantive due process case is a step too far even for this court, although there are probably a few justices who would be attracted by it,” Larson added, citing Pierce v. Society of Sisters—which allowed parents the right to send their kids to private schools—a decision of which conservatives were (and are) in favor. Unfortunately, there’s no need for Republicans to be logically or morally consistent to achieve their end game. For example, Professor Murray says that executive privilege is not an enumerated right in the Constitution, but Republicans are fine with Trump exercising the privilege to escape accountability. There’s no mention of qualified immunity in the Constitution, but Republicans grant police officers all the qualified immunity they want to escape accountability for their abuses—often at the expense of Black communities. Republicans are for national security, until they’re fine openly supporting a violent insurrection and a coup. Republicans are pro-free market and pro-corporate speech, unless a corporation like Disney pushes back against Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, and then they’re perfectly fine using the government’s power to punish them. Republicans are the alleged defenders of free speech, unless, of course, that speech threatens them, then they’re fine banning books. Republicans complain about liberal judicial activism, until they obtain power and use the court to invalidate the will of the majority. When I talked to Professor Murray last week about the possibility of the majority losing all of these hard-earned rights, she was shocked that people weren’t taking the threat seriously. “No one is doing anything,” she lamented. “We are asleep at the wheel.” It seems the leaked opinion finally got people’s attention. Crowds started gathering last night outside the Supreme Court demanding protection for women’s rights and upholding Roe v. Wade. Democratic Senators are openly calling to codify Roe into law by eliminating the filibuster. With almost 70 percent of the population against overturning Roe, Democrats have a galvanizing issue to mobilize their voters and even some independents. Sometimes it has to get worse for things to get better. At the very least, it forces people to wake up."

Madison Cawthorn appears to have violated the STOCK Act by failing to disclose 'let's go brandon' cryptocurrency purchase,"Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina appears to have violated a federal conflict-of-interest law by failing to report his stake in a cryptocurrency named for the anti-Joe Biden slogan ""Let's Go Brandon."" By law, members of Congress must quickly and publicly report their crypto purchases in certified congressional documents, known as periodic transaction reports. The purchase appears to have happened in late December, according to Cawthorn's Instagram profile. Cawthorn could've lied about purchasing the crypto, or he could've told the truth but failed to file the required documents. If he did make the purchase, he could be penalized over explicit House rules on cryptocurrency disclosure. ""All financial disclosure filings must disclose ownership interests of virtual currency"" worth more than $1,000, as well as ""purchases, sales or exchanges of cryptocurrencies,"" the House Committee on Ethics wrote in a 2018 memorandum to lawmakers and congressional staffers. Cawthorn's office did not reply to Insider's questions about what happened. He would have had no more than 30 days to make the disclosure, given that he would clearly have had direct knowledge of the purchase. Under congressional rules, he could face a minimum fine of $200, but the House Committee on Ethics could grant him a waiver that would absolve him of the fine. News about the crypto purchase was originally published in the Washington Examiner, which reported that Cawthorn may be in violation of insider-trading laws. If true, such a crime would be a matter for the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate. The Committee on House Ethics could also involve itself — and should, one Republican senator said. ""Insider trading by a member of Congress is a serious betrayal of their oath, and Congressman Cawthorn owes North Carolinians an explanation. There needs to be a thorough and bipartisan inquiry into the matter by the House Ethics Committee,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who has endorsed one of Cawthorn's primary challengers, said Wednesday. On December 30, the value of all let's go brandon coins in circulation eclipsed $570 million. By the end of January, its market cap dropped to $0. If Cawthorn violated the STOCK Act, he would join 59 other members of Congress who have violated the 2012 Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act. The law clarified that it was illegal for members of Congress to engage in insider trading and created disclosure requirements that allow the public to see whether their representatives can personally benefit in the votes they cast or the legislation they introduce. If lawmakers don't disclose details of their finances, or do so in a timely way, the public is left in the dark about potential conflicts of interest. Cawthorn's nondisclosure of his stated purchase ""raises serious questions of whether Cawthorn violated the law,"" said Kedric Payne of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, who previously served as the deputy chief counsel of the Office of Congressional Ethics. ""The lawmaker should explain the discrepancy because the public has a right to know that their elected officials are not violating the law."" Based on what's already in the public domain, ""there is at least a strong case to be made that Rep. Cawthorn violated the STOCK Act's reporting requirements as well as potentially engaging in insider trading,"" Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the government-affairs manager for the nonpartisan watchdog organization Project on Government Oversight, said, adding: ""I'm reminded of the expression about something that quacks like a duck probably being a duck."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Cawthorn. Saul Loeb and Caroline Brehman/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images Numerous Cawthorn controversies Cawthorn has faced repeated controversy as a lawmaker even as a first-year congressman. On Tuesday, officers cited him for carrying a loaded 9-millimeter handgun inside Charlotte Douglas International Airport. He was previously cited but not charged in February 2021 for trying to bring a gun onto a plane in his carry-on luggage at Asheville Regional Airport. Last month, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy publicly rebuked Cawthorn after he said on a podcast that he'd seen Washington Republicans use cocaine and that he'd been asked to participate in an orgy. Cawthorn's personal finances have also clashed with his policy positions. He has been an outspoken critic of ""Big Tech"" but made up to $100,200 in capital gains from investments in Amazon, Apple, and Comcast, Insider previously reported. In February, Cawthorn introduced a resolution to ""deregulate cryptocurrencies and incentivize blockchain innovation."""

The ""Time Off to Vote Act"" would close gaps in state laws, U.S. Representative Nikema Williams of Georgia said in a statement, citing the long lines at polling places seen in her state and others during previous elections. Democrats, led by U.S. President Joe Biden, tried earlier this year to get major voting rights legislation passed, but were prevented by two centrist Democratic senators' refusal to eliminate the filibuster in the Senate, a mechanism that requires most bills to gain at least 60 votes in order to advance. All 50 Senate Republicans also opposed the broad voting rights legislation. The new narrow bill would ""ensure no worker has to sacrifice their wages or jeopardize their job security to exercise their sacred right to vote,"" Democratic Representative Andy Levin, a co-sponsor, said in a statement. Many Democrats are concerned that the lack of action on voting rights will hurt them in November's midterm elections, particularly in states like Georgia where they won narrow victories after campaigning hard on protecting access to the ballot box. A voting rights bill that was passed by the House in January but buried by the Senate would have established minimum federal voting standards so that any registered voter could request a mail-in ballot. It also would have established at least two weeks of early voting and expanded use of ballot drop boxes that make voting more convenient in many areas."

Raskin announced that the House will be holding eight hearings on the probe into last year's Capitol insurrection. Raskin alluded that the upcoming hearings will come with shocking revelations. ""We now have evidence to support the story of the worst presidential political offense against the Union in American history,"" Raskin tweeted Friday. ""The [January 6th Committee] hearings in June will expose every facet of the assault against our democracy and Constitution on 1/6."" Raskin said the committee will present evidence of former President Donald Trump's alleged coordination with his supporters that aided in the attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump has continuously denied any wrongdoing. The former president has accused the left of personally attacking his presidency. ""No president has ever come close to doing what happened here in terms of trying to organize an inside coup to overthrow an election and bypass the constitutional order,"" Raskin said at an event on Thursday, according to NBC. ""And then also use a violent insurrection made up of domestic violent extremist groups, white nationalist and racist, fascist groups in order to support the coup."" However, Raskin says the probe isn't just about Trump, but about his alleged actions against the country. ""This was not a coup directed at the president,"" Raskin said. ""It was a coup directed by the president against the vice president and against the Congress."" Raskin told CBS's Robert Costa on Thursday that the committee had not decided if it wanted former Vice President Mike Pence to testify in the hearings. Raskin has, however, tweeted about Pence several times when bringing up the Capitol assault, causing some to wonder if he could be a key witness for the investigation. ""After fleeing Trump's mob on 1/6 with Secret Service detail, Pence refused to be driven from Capitol before certifying election, uttering 6 of the most chilling words in US history: 'I'm not getting in the car.' America must tell Trump's cult: we're not getting in the car either,"" Raskin tweeted. While the witness list forms, Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House committee, said the eight hearings will work to tell a story of what happened on the Capitol Grounds. Thompson also told reporters that the committee will ask at least three Republican lawmakers to come before the committee by the end of the week. The chairman said the public hearings will be held during daytime and prime-time programming."

Instead, it’s more that people are leaving certain careers to seize better opportunities in others, Kashkari said during a talk Friday at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. Workers employed in long-haul trucking might be entertaining local driving jobs that keep them closer to their families, for example, while child-care workers could be considering less stressful, higher-paying jobs in retail. “There’s a churn away … from the toughest jobs to more attractive jobs,” Kashkari said. “That’s something we’re all going to have to adjust to, because we need long-haul truck drivers; as much as Silicon Valley says they’re all going to be out of a job soon, it’s going to take longer than they think. And we need child-care workers. So we’re going to all have to make adjustments, and that probably means adjustments in wages.” Earlier in the talk, Kashkari also said that businesses “always say” there’s a worker shortage, “because they don’t want to have to pay up higher wages.” (To be sure, the tight labor market has forced higher wages, though inflation is eating into those gains.) Kashkari isn’t the first to theorize that workers are searching for greener pastures, rather than fleeing the workforce entirely. Indeed, for the nearly 57 million Americans who left their jobs between January 2021 and February 2022, nearly 89 million people were hired, according to government data. Some experts have said that the so-called “Great Resignation” is more of a “Great Renegotiation” or “Great Reshuffle.” Career paths that have long been known for low wages — jobs in public-school education, residential-care facilities, or daycares, for example — carried greater health risks and ample stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially some leading workers to reevaluate. Due to labor shortages, people employed in those fields were also able to weigh the potential downsides of their current job and be a bit more choosy moving forward, which often translated to better pay. A survey of 5,000 employees by tax advisory firm Grant Thornton found that four in ten people who switched jobs received pay raises of 10% or more. But labor shortages in some of the country’s toughest industries could have widespread ramifications. Consider nursing and residential care facilities, which have lost hundreds of thousands of workers since the onset of the pandemic, according to government data. Last year, during a four-week period ending in mid-October, nearly a third of American nursing homes were reporting a shortage of nurses or aides, according to an AARP analysis, which can lead to worse outcomes for residents. Many nursing homes have also limited new admissions, according to Kaiser Health News."

Boeing disclosed Wednesday that it has lost a whopping $1.1 billion in costs related to its deal with the Trump administration to modify two 747 jumbo jets to serve as Air Force One — and CEO Dave Calhoun admitted the aviation giant ""probably"" should not have cut the deal in the first place. Even more losses on the Air Force One contract could be coming in future quarters, Boeing warned in a regulatory filing. Air Force One is the official designation for any plane carrying the president of the United States. ""Air Force One I'm just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken,"" Calhoun said on a call with analysts. ""But we are where we are, and we're going to deliver great airplanes,"" Calhoun said, shortly after Boeing reported a loss for the first quarter of 2022. ""And we're going to recognize the costs associated with it."" Boeing on Wednesday disclosed a net loss of $1.2 billion for the first quarter, with a charge of $660 million associated with delays and higher costs for the Air Force One program. The company said the first-quarter charge on the Air Force One program brings the total loss tied to it to more than $1.1 billion. ""Risk remains that we may be required to record additional losses in future periods,"" Boeing said in a securities filing. Boeing's deal for the Air Force One jets was cut by then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg and then-President Donald Trump in February 2018. It requires Boeing, not the federal government, to eat any overruns in the cost of modifying the two Boeing 747 jets. Under that fixed-price contract, Boeing is being paid about $4 billion for the work. The first of the two planes was set to be delivered in 2024, but an Air Force budget proposal from earlier this month doesn't expect that until 2026. Trump in 2018 bragged that ""Boeing gave us a good deal. And we were able to take that."" Four years ago, Boeing spoke favorably about the move. ""Boeing is proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American Presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers,"" it tweeted in February 2018. ""President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people."" Trump also told CBS News that the planes would get rid of Air Force One's traditional baby blue color scheme in favor of ""red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate."" ""Air Force One is going to be incredible,"" Trump said at the time. ""It's going to be top of the line, the top of the world."" A month after being elected president in November 2016, Trump had griped on Twitter about the ""out of control"" costs of Boeing's then deal to build a new Air Force One. ""Cancel order!"" Trump tweeted at the time. He later boasted that his negotiations with Muilenburg saved $1.5 billion for taxpayers. Boeing fired Muilenburg as CEO in December 2019 for how he handled two crashes of the company's 737 Max jets that killed 346 people. He was denied a severance package, but received $60 million in pension benefits and company stock, Boeing said a month after he was ousted."
/r/politics/comments/u8f0yp/sanders_says_its_time_to_end_the_failed_war_on/,1650514551,https://truthout.org/articles/sanders-says-its-time-to-end-the-failed-war-on-drugs-and-legalize-marijuana/,26675,Sanders Says It’s Time to “End the Failed War on Drugs” and Legalize Marijuana,"n Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) called for marijuana to be legalized and for past marijuana-related convictions to be erased, as legislation to do so has stalled in the Senate. “Legalize marijuana. Expunge past marijuana convictions. End the failed War on Drugs,” Sanders wrote on Twitter. Sanders’s statement came among an influx of other legislators calling for the passage of the Marijuana Opportunity and Reinvestment (MORE) Act, which the House voted to pass earlier this month. The bill, which would allow people convicted of certain marijuana crimes to have their records expunged and fully decriminalize marijuana across the country, has stalled in the Senate, where it has little chance of passing due to Republican opposition and the filibuster. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) called for the abolishment of the filibuster in order to pass the legislation. “Today would be a great day for the Senate to end the filibuster and pass the MORE Act — which would legalize marijuana and expunge records,” Jayapal said on Wednesday. Senate Democrats say that they’re working on their own legislation to legalize marijuana that would tweak the way marijuana importers and sellers are taxed. Legalizing marijuana is a hugely popular issue among voters. In November, Gallup found that support for marijuana legalization, which has been increasing steadily over the past decades, is at an all-time high of 68 percent. Drug legalization advocates and people convicted of marijuana-related crimes say that the passage of the MORE Act could be a huge advancement of social justice in the country. Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana; Black and Latino men also receive longer prison sentences than white men arrested on similar drug charges. Even with legalization, these racist disparities remain. In every state where marijuana is currently legal, Black people are still more likely to be arrested for marijuana-related charges. The MORE Act takes steps to try to alleviate racial justice issues created by marijuana criminalization and the war on drugs by taxing sales on legal marijuana and redistributing the funds to communities that were especially damaged by the war on drugs. It would also require the Bureau of Labor Statistics to regularly publish data on the demographics of marijuana business owners and employees in hopes of bringing transparency to the industry, which is currently mostly white-owned. Some social justice activists have also been seeking to create democratically-owned businesses as the marijuana industry develops from its nascent stages. In Rhode Island, for instance, workers are asking state legislators to reserve licenses for worker-owned cooperatives within the industry in order to ensure that there’s space for more equitable businesses with support and participation from the communities they serve. Legalizing marijuana could also be a huge boon for the government’s coffers. A recent report found that states that have decriminalized marijuana have collected more than $10 billion in tax revenues since 2014. Additionally, a study released last week found that legal marijuana reduces demand for prescription drugs obtained through Medicaid funded by state programs. “The reductions in drug utilization that we find could lead to significant cost savings for state Medicaid programs,” said Shyam Raman, a doctoral student at Cornell University and co-author of the study. “The results also indicate an opportunity to reduce the harm that can come with the dangerous side effects associated with some prescription drugs.”"

By September 2021, the scientists and staffers at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission had gathered enough data to know that the trees in its green-tree reservoirs — a type of hardwood wetland ecosystem — were dying. At Hurricane Lake, a wildlife management area of 17,000 acres, the level of severe illness and death in the timber population was up to 42 percent, especially for certain species of oak, according to a 2014 forest-health assessment. The future of another green-tree reservoir, Bayou Meto, more than 33,000 acres, would look the same if they didn’t act quickly. There were a lot of reasons the trees were dying, but it was also partly the commission’s fault. Long ago, the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers and their tributaries would have flooded the bayous naturally, filling bottomland forests during the winter months when the trees were dormant and allowing new saplings to grow after the waters receded in the spring. Widespread European settlement and agriculture largely halted the natural flooding, but in the 1950s, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission began buying bottomland forests for preservation, which it then flooded with a system of levees and other tools. This made the forests an ideal winter stop for ducks to eat and rest on their annual migration south. Arkansas is a magnet for duck hunters, and the state has issued more than 100,000 permits for duck hunters from Arkansas and out of state for every year since 2014. But it turned out the commission was flooding the reservoirs too early and at levels too high, which was damaging the trees. The ducks that arrive in Arkansas especially love eating the acorns from a certain species of oak — and those oaks are now dying. Austin Booth, director of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, knew that convincing the state’s duck hunters and businesses that there was a serious problem would be tricky. Part of the solution the commission planned to propose to save the trees involved delaying the annual fall flooding, which could mean less habitat for the ducks, fewer ducks stopping in the area and more duck hunters crowded into smaller spaces fighting over targets. And all the duck hunters would have their own ideas about who to blame for the problem and what the solution should be. Last September, Booth gave a brief speech that was streamed live on YouTube, outlining the problem. He announced a series of public meetings to begin in the following months. Booth told me that when he began to plan those meetings, he thought of all the government meetings and town halls he’d attended after years working in politics. “I wanted to ratchet down some of the intensity that happens when a government official stands up on a stage and talks down to people,” he said. Instead, he decided the meetings would be dinners where the Game and Fish staff would eat alongside the people they sought to convince. “I just believe there’s a human component to sitting down and having a meal with someone,” he said. At those dinners, he’d give a brief introduction, then invite people to ask questions of the staff as they ate and mingled. At the end of the dinners, Booth said he’d stand up again and ask, “Is there anyone that’s going to walk through that door tonight without their questions answered or comments taken for the record, or with their concerns ignored?” No one, he said, came forward. The four dinners were attended by between 50 and 100 people, according to Booth, but those attendees then spread the word, dampening criticism of the new management system. What’s interesting about this dinner program is that it began during the COVID-19 pandemic, which also required effective science communication to convince the public to accept changes, major and minor, to their lives. Even before this pandemic, there’s been a long history of resistance to public health measures and new vaccines, and many researchers suspected that could likely be the case with COVID-19 as well. The social scientists who study these issues might have counseled an approach like that employed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, using local messengers who had relationships with the communities in question and who could communicate in less intimidating ways. But the U.S. did not do that with COVID-19. Instead, rapidly changing information came from only a few sources, usually at the national level and seemingly without much strategy. And as such, many places have seen widespread resistance to public health interventions, like wearing masks and getting the vaccine. The intensely local, personal way that Arkansas Game and Fish approached this challenge is difficult, time-consuming and perhaps not always the most practical. But it shows the kind of intensity it takes to communicate an urgent problem, and may provide lessons for how to approach the next big problems — whether that’s another pandemic, an ecological disaster or something bigger and more existential, like climate change. Before the pandemic, Matthew Motta, a political science professor at Oklahoma State University, and his colleagues Timothy Callaghan, Steven Sylvester, Kristin Lunz Trujillo and Christine Crudo Blackburn studied parents’ hesitancy about giving their kids routine vaccinations, like those for measles, mumps and rubella. Reasons varied, and the most prominent was conspiratorial thinking.1 Some parents who delayed their children’s vaccines also held strong ideas about moral/bodily purity, which often correlated with higher levels of religiosity. Evangelical Christians, people who distrusted scientists and other experts and people prone to believing in conspiracies were also among the groups finding a home in the Republican Party, too. Many of these characteristics also tend to cluster in rural areas, where COVID-19 vaccination rates continue to lag. “With the very important caveat that we’re talking about two different vaccines … I would say it’s roughly the same groups of people,” Motta said. “My colleagues and I … tried to shout this from the rooftops. … We saw this coming for sure.” In July 2021, as coronavirus cases rose in Arkansas, demonstrators gathered outside a community town hall at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home to protest vaccine mandates. In subsequent research conducted before the pandemic, Motta and his colleagues found possible paths to countering vaccine hesitancy. “One way we can try to get skeptics on board with vaccinating is to just make an effort to understand why they’re skeptical, and portray the benefits of vaccinating in those terms,” Motta said. For example, Americans who felt that vaccines tainted their moral/bodily purity were given information about how viruses also attacked and invaded the body, which raised their opinions of vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines, however, were rolled out without much of that targeted messaging. Worsening the matter, then-President Donald Trump and his administration made a series of missteps and promoted misinformation, which only further hampered the country’s ability to form a coherent plan. On top of that, the virus was fast moving from the beginning of the pandemic, and the United States is a big country with multiple public health agencies, each with a different level of authority. The authority that state and local health departments have varies by state, which meant communication strategies were varied as well. Meanwhile, in much of rural America, hospitals had already gone through waves of closures, in addition to decades of underinvestment in rural public health. Some nonprofit groups struggled to correct these rural disparities, but unfortunately, the underlying issues were too deep-rooted for them to fully counteract. Rural Americans were far less likely to take precautions against COVID-19, like wearing a mask, avoiding restaurants or working from home. Last September, during the delta wave, the death rate in rural areas was double that of urban areas. As of Jan. 10, 2022, only 48 percent of rural Americans were vaccinated, compared with 61 percent of their urban counterparts, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite local events promoting the safeness and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, rural areas overall still lag in getting vaccinated. These patterns are partly explained by preexisting issues. People in rural areas hold old, well-known anxieties about scientists, particularly when the scientists come from the government. Kristin Lunz Trujillo, a postdoctoral researcher with the COVID States Project, said this anxiety stemmed from an attitude that pits rural, hands-on knowledge against the kind of knowledge obtained from institutions like universities or government bureaucracies — a kind of anti-establishment view that extends to scientists. Lunz Trujillo told me an example of this phenomenon is land-grant institutions using their rural extension services to bring the latest agricultural research to recalcitrant farmers who don’t want to be told how to farm. This was illustrated in the 1983 TV movie “The Day After,” in which a Missouri farmer played by John Cullum points out the impracticality of a government agent’s plan to scrape up all of the topsoil following a nuclear explosion — acres of soil that would have nowhere to go. “Where did you get this information, John, all this good advice? Out of some government pamphlet?” Cullum’s character yells at the agent. And now this attitude has become more entwined with partisanship and partisan politics. In a 2021 paper published in American Political Science Review, political scientists David C. Barker, Ryan Detamble and Morgan Marietta looked at Republicans’ growing distrust of scientists and other experts. Their research shows that partly due to the education divide — i.e., college graduates prefer the Democratic Party, and white people without a college degree prefer the Republican Party — the divide between those who are pro-intellectualism and those who are anti-intellectualism is more entrenched in party politics. Importantly, Barker and his colleagues defined anti-intellectualism not as a respondent's ability or personal level of education. Instead, it was about respondents having positive feelings about trusting one’s gut and having negative feelings toward experts, schools and “the book-smarts of intellectuals.” In their paper, the researchers wrote that those who distrust scientists and other official sources of authority “distinguish those who are ‘book smart’ from those who have common sense, the latter of which they view as a superior means of ascertaining truth.” They found that people with this attitude were more likely to align with the Republican Party. Which makes sense. Trump has promoted the vaccine-autism myth and falsely claimed that climate change is a hoax. Trump’s anti-intellectualism surely attracted voters who already shared these beliefs, but he also might have influenced other people to take up such beliefs. According to one study, he was the primary spreader of COVID-19 misinformation. These partisan trends existed before Trump’s presidency, of course, but Barker and his colleagues wrote that they spiked during his tenure. And instead of receding once Trump left the national stage, the partisan realignment seems to be firmer than ever. Trump’s skepticism toward COVID-19 precautions likely both attracted voters already holding such beliefs and inspired others to adopt them. CHENEY ORR / BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY IMAGES This past February, Lunz Trujillo published work that shows this kind of anti-science attitude is associated with having a rural identity. And this identity is held not only by people who live in rural areas, but also by people who strongly identify as rural, regardless of where they currently live. “It’s more how people think of themselves versus where they are,” Lunz Trujillo said. She cited the political scientist Katherine J. Cramer’s well-known work on rural resentment, which illustrated that many rural people disdained anything perceived to be urban — racial and ethnic minorities, liberals, the LGBTQ community, cultural elites — and tied it to their rejection of intellectuals and intellectualism as well. The key insight to all this work is that those who distrust vaccines, science and expertise aren’t doing so necessarily because they have a knowledge gap or a misunderstanding. Distrusting experts is part of their identity. Motta and his colleagues’ work suggests that being anti-vaccine has become an identity, too. In some respects, distrusting experts has become a political choice, which means that any message from an official source — whether it’s a researcher, head of a government agency or a journalist — is more likely to inspire the opposite of its intended reaction from those who view that source as part of the political opposition. These trends might be spreading to include some experts themselves. Motta released a paper earlier this month that shows about 10 percent of primary care physicians were uncertain about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, despite abundant evidence that they have been extremely safe and effective. The vaccine-hesitant doctors shared many of the same characteristics as other vaccine skeptics: They were more likely to be rural and conservative. For rural areas especially, this data suggests a vicious feedback loop. People who were suspicious of the vaccines had doctors who were suspicious, too. As Barker and his colleagues wrote, the danger of anti-intellectualism becoming more entwined with partisanship is that these attitudes then become more entrenched and harder to overcome. And that will become true on both sides, as each group believes they have the best sources of information — a phenomenon he called epistemic hubris. It’s damaging public debate. The problems we’ve seen with COVID-19 are also spreading to new groups of people and to other issues. Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, researches the social science of climate change, and she’s found that people are more likely to seek out sources that confirm what they already believe. “We see that scientific information is very, very clearly cherry-picked,” she said. Increasingly, she sees people looking for information that already supports their worldview, and that’s happening on the right and left. For her, this includes policymakers who have a role to play in solving issues like climate change. The challenge is how to penetrate these bubbles. Luke Naylor is the waterfowl program coordinator at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. I recently went with him to visit Bayou Meto, which locals pronounce as “bio-mee-da.” There’s no real way to measure this, but the nearby city of Stuttgart calls itself the duck-hunting capital of the world. On the way to the bayou, down a mostly empty two-lane highway, we stopped at a gas station decorated in woodland camouflage. Naylor told me the owner of the gas station opens before dawn during duck-hunting season to serve that clientele. Earlier this month, Luke and his colleague Jason Jackson took me through part of the bayou to show me the dead trees. Certain species of oak were under unique stress because they sat in water for too long during the year, and the bases of some trees were swollen. As we stood on a levee, Naylor and Jackson pointed out a tree they’d watched die over the previous summer as well as other trees showing signs of distress. Elsewhere, we saw trees downed in clusters. Even someone without an idea of what to look for would have been stunned. Tree experts had started to notice these issues in the 1980s and 1990s, Naylor told me. I asked him if hunters had raised their own concerns, and he said they noticed more now that the issues had been pointed out to them. “We put a name on some stuff back when we started talking about it openly,” Naylor said. “People look at it like, ‘Huh, that tree is bigger right there,’ or ‘They’re all leaning.’” Some isolated dead trees are blamed on ice storms or other rough weather, he said, but the sheer number of dead trees becomes more obvious once you know how to recognize the signs. “You’re running your boat through here or try to walk through it duck-hunting, you notice real quick.” Climate change is expected to bring more severe flooding to Arkansas. YELL COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT VIA AP Heavy waters from the fall flooding and spring rains were still trying to flow out of the reservoir. The water had to flow through levees built decades ago by the federal government, when building the levees was treated as an engineering problem, not an ecological one. The channels also had various right angles, which slowed the water’s course, making it hard to clear the reservoir as needed. This was the next problem they wanted to tackle: redesigning the old levees. They said that some hunters unhappy about the changes to the intentional flooding in the fall thought that spring rains were the real problem. “We never said it wasn’t,” Naylor said. Spring rains definitely sit in the reservoirs for too long and for too late in the year. The issue was that the levees are old and expensive, and changing them to deal with the spring rains would be a multimillion-dollar and multiyear project. Naylor and Booth, the head of Game and Fish, both repeated the same message: that the fall flooding was something they were already doing incorrectly, and was a problem they could control and a solution they could easily enact. That’s why they chose that route first. Taking ownership of the problem was the key to the program’s success, they said. I asked Naylor and Booth each if any of the hunters they’d spoken to asked about an obvious potential culprit: climate change. Naylor said that no one had. And while it’s true that the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission had been intentionally flooding the green-tree reservoirs too early and too much, climate change is expected to bring more severe flooding to Arkansas, and heavy spring downpours are likely to increase in the years ahead. The region is already seeing wetter springs and higher rivers because the northern plains — where the headwaters for the Mississippi River are — are wetter, too. That potentially controversial aspect was mostly avoided in their conversations with the hunters, which may show the limits of this approach. Whatever methods any group or agency takes to deal with a local ecological problem will be only a small piece of the puzzle if climate change exacerbates the core of those problems. Partisanship already affects views on climate change and how to solve it — or whether it needs solving at all. What struck me most about my time with Naylor and Jackson is that they were both also hunters and, despite being experts in their field, already had a level of trust with the hunters they were trying to convince. They spoke with mid-Southern accents, drove trucks and wore camo. They’re well-educated experts, but it’s hard to imagine that local and out-of-state duck hunters would see them as eggheads that could be easily dismissed. When Booth described his staff’s expertise to me, he said they had “dirt under their fingernails,” which was similar to how Lunz Trujillo explained the kind of experiential knowledge valued by farmers and other rural folks. But not every issue manifests locally, with local experts able to gather people for friendly dinners. Regarding climate change, Fisher says in her work now she is finding that people are often spurred to action only when the environmental damage becomes an extreme personal risk to them and their family, and when it is seen as preventable. Part of the problem with mitigating COVID-19, she said, was that many people didn’t see the virus as a personal risk — they thought they themselves would be OK, even if so many other people were dying. Public pushback on the changes that the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has made to green-tree reservoirs has so far been minimal, according to Booth, but the commission also has a captive audience. Duck hunters, other hunters and fishermen rely on information from the commission every year to apply for licenses and announce when public lands are open for hunting. These hunters visit government-run websites regularly to check water levels and other information to plan their hunting trips. Plus, the green-tree reservoirs are entirely owned and managed by the commission, which means how to manage the lands is its decision. I asked James Brandenburg, an Arkansas volunteer with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a conservation organization that tries to engage hunters and fishers, whether this kind of approach was scalable. Could we do something like what Arkansas Game and Fish did with larger-scale problems? He described how one of the biggest benefits he’d seen at the dinners was that hunters and other affected groups could ask questions and voice their concerns — and that they were heard, whether or not what they said made a difference in the decisions. “I don't know that it needs to be scalable, it just needs to be repeated,” he said. “We have to have the people who are willing to listen. You have to have the decision-makers who are invested enough in the process of gathering that information to make it a priority to have the conversations.” Increasingly, though, the question is how to have those conversations in the first place. It’s hard to share information if people reject it because it comes from experts and is reported through the mainstream press. That will determine, as much as anything, how we respond to serious challenges moving forward."

Susan Collins, a rare GOP supporter of abortion rights who is under scrutiny for her key role in confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court amid fears that Roe v. Wade may soon be overturned, signaled to reporters on Thursday that she would oppose a bill that Democrats plan to bring to the Senate floor next week to codify abortion rights. The bill, known as the the Women’s Health Protection Act, is on track to fail in the Senate with or without support from the Maine Republican, but the swing vote senator’s likely opposition underscores how difficult it is to reach bipartisan consensus on the contentious issue of abortion and comes as Democrats face enormous pressure to take action after a Supreme Court draft opinion to strike down Roe v. Wade leaked this week. Collins voted in support of both Neil Gorsuch’s and Kavanaugh’s confirmations and has previously said Kavanaugh told her he agreed that Roe v. Wade is settled law. The senator said on Tuesday that the draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade was “completely inconsistent” with what Gorsuch and Kavanaugh “said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.” She did not go so far as to say, though, that she had been misled by Kavanaugh. When asked that question by CNN, she said, “My statement speaks for itself.” Collins has introduced her own bill with Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to codify abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade. Collins argued on Thursday that the measure put forward by Democrats is too broad and raised concerns about the bill not including a so-called conscience clause, which would allow providers to refuse to perform abortions for religious or moral reasons. “It supersedes all other federal and state laws, including the conscience protections that are in the Affordable Care Act,” said Collins. She added, “It doesn’t protect the right of a Catholic hospital to not perform abortions. That right has been enshrined in law for a long time.” Collins voted against a previous version of the Women’s Health Protection Act in February for similar reasons. The bill she has put forward with Murkowski is narrower, which Democrats such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, an author of the Women’s Health Protection Act, have criticized as having “loopholes” for states to continue restricting abortion. Blumenthal on Thursday pushed back on Collins’ reasoning about the Democrats’ bill. “There is nothing in this measure that detracts in any way from existing protections based on conscience or religion,” he said. “It doesn’t mandate that a hospital or a doctor or any other provider do anything that is against religious principles or conscience.” Despite the fact that the measure is expected to fail, Democrats are moving forward with a vote on their bill next week amid renewed pressure from their voters to act. Abortion rights advocates were stunned this week by the bombshell publication by Politico of a draft of a majority Supreme Court opinion that would strike down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion nationwide. The court confirmed the authenticity of the document Tuesday, though it also stressed it was not the final decision. The problem for Democrats is that they do not have the votes to pass their measure – yet another limitation of their narrow majority in the Senate. The legislation would need at least 60 votes to overcome a GOP filibuster, which would require 10 Republicans to vote with Democrats if all Democrats voted in favor. That is not expected to happen. Adding to the trouble for Democrats is that their own caucus is not even unified on the issue. Sen. Joe Manchin, a key moderate Democrat who represents the red state of West Virginia, has previously described himself as “pro-life and proud of it” and “a lifelong abortion opponent.” And Manchin and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania have broken with their party on abortion-related votes in the Senate before. In February, when Republicans blocked the Women’s Health Protection Act in the Senate, the tally came down to a nearly party-line vote, with Manchin voting with Republicans in opposition."

In a statement, RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the commission is “biased and has refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms to help ensure fair debates including hosting debates before voting begins and selecting moderators who have never worked for candidates on the debate stage.” The commission was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit sponsored by both the Republican and Democratic Parties and has sponsored debates in every presidential election since 1988. The group’s co-chairs include former RNC chairman Frank Fahrenkopf. CNN has reached out to the commission for comment. Thursday’s vote comes after months of signals from the RNC that it sought a break from the commission. In June 2021, McDaniel sent a letter outlining several complaints about the commission’s practices, reflecting former President Donald Trump’s concerns about the conduct of the 2020 debates. And in January, McDaniel sent another letter threatening to “prohibit future Republican nominees from participating in CPD-sponsored debates” unless the commission changed its rules. The RNC claims it has not pulled its future nominees out of debates entirely. The commission drew considerable ire from Trump during the 2020 campaign, with him and his campaign aides often railing about the selected moderators, the commission’s decision to hold the second debate virtually during the coronavirus pandemic and the choice to mute each candidate’s mic during the final debate after the first contest included considerable interruptions from the then-President. Moderators were a central issue for Republicans in 2020 – especially the selection of C-SPAN’s Steve Scully to moderate what would have been the second contest. The Trump campaign attacked Scully for working for Biden roughly four decades earlier, leading the journalist to accidentally publicly reach out on Twitter to Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s short-lived White House communications director. When the outreach frustrated Republicans, Scully said he had been hacked, something he later admitted was not true. C-SPAN then placed Scully on “administrative leave” for lying. The commission eventually canceled the second debate after Trump declined to attend a virtual debate despite concerns over his Covid-19 diagnosis. The RNC has advocated for a number of changes to the commission, including adopting term limits for its board and prohibiting members from making public comments about any candidates. McDaniel, in an echo of Trump’s concerns, has also pushed for more influence on which journalists moderate general election debates, asking the commission for a “transparent criteria for selecting debate moderators that would disqualify individuals from consideration who have apparent conflicts of interest due to personal, professional, or partisan factors.”"

Election defeats alone don’t stop wanna-be autocrats — but the law can, historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat told Politico in a lengthy interview published Saturday. “It takes prosecution and conviction to deflate their personality cults,” Ben-Ghiat said. “That’s what it takes.” Ben-Ghiat pointed to Italy’s strongman Silvio Berlusconi, who finally retreated from the political scene when he was convicted of corruption, fraud, and tax evasion. Trump checks all the boxes for history’s authoritarians, noted Ben-Ghiat, who last year published the book “Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present.” For one thing, they never leave the stage gracefully. “I just predicted that he [Trump] wouldn’t leave in a quiet manner” after he lost the election, said Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University. “He’s an authoritarian, and they can’t leave office. They don’t have good endings and they don’t leave properly.” Trump’s “Big Lie” lie that the election he definitely lost was rigged protected his brainwashed followers from “having to reckon with the fact that he lost,” said Ben-Ghiat. The tale “maintains him as their hero, as their winner, as the invincible Trump — but also as the wronged Trump, the victim. Victimhood is extremely important for all autocrats,” she noted. “They always have to be the biggest victim.” Now Trump has changed the entire nature of the Republican Party into an “authoritarian far-right party” that’s as hard on its own members as on foes, said Ben-Ghiat. “Not only do you go after external enemies, but you go after internal enemies. You’re not allowed to have any dissent,” she explained. When somebody like Trump “comes on the scene and holds office, it’s really like an earthquake or a volcano, and it shakes up the whole system by gathering in this big tent all the extremists, all the far-right people, and giving them legitimation,” said Ben-Ghiat. “The GOP was already going away from a democratic political culture, but he accelerated it and normalized extremism and normalized lawlessness.” It’s also par for the course for an autocrat like Trump out to destroy democracy to demonize democracy and its freedoms, she said. One of the “big talking points and strategy of right-wing authoritarianism is to label democratic systems as tyrannical,” Ben-Ghiat explained. “Mussolini was the first to say that democracies are tyrannical, democracies are the problem.” Still, Ben-Ghiat is not a complete pessimist. “We can never forget that in the middle of a pandemic, 80 plus million people turned out to get rid of him,” she told Politico. “That’s very rare in history where you interrupt an autocratic personality who’s in the middle of his project.”"

""Billionaires like Elon Musk play by a different set of rules than everyone else, accumulating power for their own gain,"" Warren wrote: ""We need a wealth tax and strong rules to hold Big Tech accountable."" Although Musk has yet to respond, he has a history of engaging with Warren on the platform. A high-profile spat between Warren and Musk occurred in December of 2021 after Warren said Musk was ""freeloading off of everyone else,"" Musk replied by insulting Warren, even going so far as to refer to her as ""Senator Karen"": ""You remind me of when I was a kid and my friend's angry Mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason,"" he tweeted. In another tweet, Musk continued: ""And if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year."" Musk also insulted Senator Bernie Sanders after he too tweeted about a wealth tax. Warren has been a fierce critic of Musk and other billionaires after it was revealed Musk paid no federal income tax in 2018, according to a ProPublica investigation. She has also advocated for higher tax rates for America's wealthiest earners. Representatives for Warren and Musk could not be immediately reached for comment."

""This is what oligarchy and corporate greed are all about,"" Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, tweeted Friday. ""Two large and profitable corporations, owned by billionaires, spend millions to illegally deny their workers the right to organize. No corporation that breaks the law should get a federal contract."" In a sweeping complaint filed Friday, the NLRB alleged that Starbucks committed hundreds of labor law violations in its campaign to stop Buffalo-area employees from forming a union. The NLRB also said Friday that it found merit in charges that Amazon forced Staten Island warehouse workers to attend anti-union ""captive audience"" meetings ahead of an election that the union ultimately won, a landmark victory for the U.S. labor movement. As the New York Times reported, such anti-union meetings ""are legal under current labor board precedent."" ""But last month, the board's general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, issued a memo saying that the precedent was at odds with the underlying federal statute, and she indicated that she would seek to challenge it,"" the Times noted. The NLRB on Friday also found merit in union charges that Amazon threatened to deny benefits to employees who voted to unionize and suggested--falsely--that workers could be fired if they failed to pay union dues. The labor board is expected to formally issue a complaint in the coming days detailing the charges and seeking corrective action from Amazon, which spent $4.3 million on anti-union consultants last year alone. Amazon and Starbucks are both beneficiaries of federal contracts. Earlier this year, the National Security Agency quietly re-awarded Amazon Web Services a 10-year cloud contract worth up to $10 billion, a move that runs afoul of President Joe Biden's campaign promise to ""ensure federal dollars do not flow to employers who engage in union-busting activities, participate in wage theft, or violate labor law."" As The American Prospectnoted, ""That contract comes on top of 26 other federal cloud computing contracts with the U.S. Army and Air Force; the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Interior; the U.S. Census Bureau; and numerous other agencies."" In a letter to Biden last week, Sanders urged the president to sign an executive order barring corporations that violate labor laws from contracting with the federal government. During a Senate Budget Committee hearing on Thursday, Sanders observed that ""there are hundreds of corporations in America that receive federal contracts, huge subsidies, special tax breaks, and all kinds of corporate welfare despite the fact that these same companies have engaged in widespread illegal behavior--including massive violations of labor laws."" According to the watchdog organization Good Jobs First, Amazon has received more than $3.5 billion in state and local taxpayer subsidies since 1996. ""Taxpayer dollars should not go to companies like Amazon who repeatedly break the law,"" Sanders said Thursday. ""No government--not the federal government, not the state government, and not the city government--should be handing out corporate welfare to union busters and labor law violators."""

Governor Candidate Put Hand 'Up My Dress',"Nebraska Republican state Sen. Julie Slama said she was “in shock” when Donald Trump-endorsed gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster allegedly put his hand “up my dress” at a GOP dinner. Slama detailed what she has described as an “assault” in 2019 in an interview Thursday, the day the Nebraska Examiner reported that she and seven other women had accused the Republican businessman of groping them. “As I was ... walking to my table, I felt a hand reach up my skirt, up my dress and the hand was Charles Herbster’s,” Slama said, her voice shaking, in an interview on News Radio KFAB in Omaha. “I was in shock. I was mortified. It’s one of the most traumatizing things I’ve ever been through.” Slama added: “I watched as five minutes later he grabbed the buttocks of another young woman. ... This was witnessed by several people at the event.” Slama talked of the intimidating, “huge power differential” in that situation between herself, then a newly appointed 22-year-old state senator, and “one of the biggest donors in the Nebraska Republican Party.” Herbster has denied all the accusations as “libelous fake news” and is now threatening to sue to protect his reputation. He called the timing of the allegations just weeks before the primary suspect. ADVERTISEMENT The Examiner corroborated six of the eight allegations with witnesses, the newspaper reported. All of the alleged incidents occurred between 2017 and this year, and involved teenagers to women in their 20s, according to the Examiner. All 13 female state senators in the Nebraska legislature, including five Republicans, issued a statement Thursday condemning the “highly credible, corroborated allegations.” “Sexual assault is despicable and damaging,” the statement added. “This is not a question of politics — it is an issue of character and basic human decency.” Herbster’s actions “make him unfit to serve,” the statement concluded. Herbster, owner and CEO of Conklin Company and a sometimes beauty pageant judge, is currently a front-runner in the race for Nebraska governor, even though he has never held political office. He reportedly gave $1.3 million to Trump’s campaigns and attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally outside the Capitol with members of Trump’s inner circle. Donald Trump Jr. campaigned with Herbster in Nebraska earlier this week. Trump has hailed Herbster, who considers himself a born-again Christian, as a “tremendous supporter of America First.” The allegations against Herbster aren’t likely to shake Trump’s endorsement. Trump has been accused by dozens of women of sexual misconduct. He was also recorded boasting about “grabbing” women “by the pussy.” Omaha’s former mayor reportedly responded to the accusations by saying that he wanted to put Slama on the witness stand to ask her what she was wearing when she was allegedly groped. So Slama showed him — and emphasized to KFAB that “clothes don’t equal consent.” Under Nebraska state law, touching a person inappropriately without consent on the outside of their clothes constitutes third-degree sexual assault. Former Omaha Mayor Hal Daub, in response to reports of my sexual assault: ""I'd like to ask her what she was wearing."" This dress is what I was wearing when I was sexually assaulted. https://t.co/VHliO0NovE pic.twitter.com/g47LuumFO6 — Senator Julie Slama (@SenatorSlama) April 14, 2022 The primaries for candidates for governor and lieutenant governor will be held May 10.

That's according to a new poll released Monday, two and a half weeks after the Amazon Labor Union's historic election victory at the JFK8 warehouse in New York City and ahead of next week's vote on whether to unionize a smaller Staten Island facility. The survey, conducted by Blue Rose Research on behalf of More Perfect Union, reached nearly 2,500 adults between April 7 and April 12, just days after ALU organized the first successful union drive at Amazon in U.S. history. According to More Perfect Union, 75% of respondents agreed with Amazon workers who say that they ""need union representation in order to have job security, better pay, and safer working conditions""--the same demands listed on ALU's website. ""The union's argument was significantly more popular (roughly 20 percentage points higher) than the management-side argument that workers don't need a union because they already have good pay and benefits,"" the progressive media outlet noted. Amazon's reputation among consumers remains high, but that hasn't dampened public support for the unionization of its workforce. More Perfect Union's poll found that 90% of people who have purchased something on Amazon in the past three months have a favorable opinion of the e-commerce giant. Nevertheless, 75% of these satisfied customers still backed the argument made by the company's pro-union workers. Young respondents were especially supportive of efforts to organize the country's second-largest employer, where recent data on surging workplace injuries and the widening chasm between CEO-to-median-worker pay reveals the consequences of a 40-year corporate assault on collective bargaining carried out with bipartisan support. Among respondents between the ages of 18 and 34, a whopping 83% agreed with the pro-union argument, while 80% of people aged 35 to 49 concurred. Young people who voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 were even more enthusiastic in their support for Amazon workers, with 91% of 18- to 34-year-olds and 90% of 35- to 49-year-olds in favor of unionization. As recent polling has shown a collapse in the president's approval rating among people under 35, More Perfect Union suggested that ""embracing organizing workers can help Biden restore his public standing. Even a majority of young supporters of former President Donald Trump--71% of 18- to 34-year-olds and 66% of 35- to 49-year-olds--said that Amazon workers need union representation. Support for unionizing Amazon workers was also apparent across racial categories--71% among white respondents, 75% among Asian respondents, 83% among Hispanic respondents, and 87% among Black respondents. Despite strong public support for unionization and a growing wave of worker victories nationwide, the overwhelming majority of congressional lawmakers have remained silent on ALU's win. ALU's electoral triumph at the beginning of this month was likened to ""David beats Goliath,"" given that the group, led by former and current Amazon warehouse workers and not affiliated with an established union, challenged one of the world's most powerful corporations and won--less than a year after it was created. ALU president Christian Smalls was fired by Amazon in March 2020 after he organized a walkout at the JFK8 fulfillment center to protest the company's refusal to adequately protect workers during the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, a judge ruled that Amazon must reinstate Gerald Bryson, a former employee at JFK8 who was illegally fired after leading another protest in the wake of Smalls' termination. The decision came nearly two years after Bryson filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) accusing Amazon of retaliating against him for workplace organizing. A federal lawsuit filed last month by the NLRB on behalf of Bryson has been cited by Amazon in its objections to the JFK8 election results. Amazon is seeking to overturn ALU's victory after losing at the ballot box. Amazon, which spent $4.3 million on anti-union consultants in 2021 alone, pulled out all the stops to undermine ALU organizers before their first election--forcing workers to attend hundreds of captive-audience meetings, threatening workers with pay cuts, and hiring a Democratic Party-aligned firm to assist with its failed union-busting campaign. While Smalls, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and others were celebrating ALU's stunning achievement, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama forged ahead with their second attempt to unionize. Hundreds of ballots are still being challenged following an inconclusive early April vote. The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) has filed more than 20 objections to Amazon's conduct with the NLRB. Back in New York City, ALU faces the difficult task of negotiating with Amazon, a corporation that is already immensely powerful and now potentially even more hostile. According to a Bloomberg Law analysis from last year, it takes longer than a year on average for new unions and employers to sign their first collective bargaining agreement. Many unions, due to bad-faith negotiating by employers and other factors, never succeed in securing their first contract. HuffPost labor reporter Dave Jamieson noted earlier this month that ""Amazon would have a strong incentive not to offer the union a decent deal, for fear it would only encourage more unionization elsewhere."" Workers at more than 100 of the retail giant's facilities throughout the U.S. have contacted ALU about organizing their workplaces. The union's second election in Staten Island is less than a week away. Voting is set to begin on April 25 at Amazon's 1,500-worker LDJ5 warehouse, where the company has been accused of ""playing really dirty"" in an attempt to prevent a repeat performance by ALU."

However, ""young Americans had no clear consensus on a path forward related to student loan debt,"" with 38% of overall respondents wanting all debt canceled, 27% agreeing that the government should assist with--but not cancel--repayment, 21% favoring cancellation for the neediest borrowers, and 13% supporting the status quo. Among Democratic voters, the survey found 43% support for canceling all debt, 19% wanting some government help, 29% backing cancellation for those in need, and 4% favoring current policy. ""Opinions on this issue do not differ significantly among likely voters in the 2022 midterms compared to the broader population of 18-to-29-year-olds,"" said IOP, ""as 83% of young likely voters express a preference for government action, including 79% of those not in college now, and without a degree."" The IOP survey also found: * A majority (54%) of white Americans and 49% of Asian-Americans under 30 ""strongly"" agreed with the statement, ""I grew up thinking it was possible for me to go to college,"" compared to only 32% of Black Americans and 38% of Latinos under 30; and * Forty-eight percent of young Americans agree--but only 18% strongly agree--with the statement, ""Going to college is worth the time and money,"" while 26% disagreed and 24% chose a neutral position. The survey also revealed that young people are increasingly cynical about the ability of electoral politics to deliver solutions to the world's problems. In what IOP called a ""warning sign that interest in voting in the 2022 midterms could wane,"" the survey found a sharp increase in the percentage of youth who agree that ""political involvement rarely has any tangible results,"" from 22% in 2018 to 36% in 2022. More than four in 10 survey respondents also agreed with the assertion that their vote won't ""make a real difference,"" while over half of those surveyed believe that ""politics today are no longer able to meet the challenges our country is facing."""

Wade,"Critics were stunned Saturday after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas scolded Americans for not accepting controversial rulings — after his own wife battled against the results of a legitimate presidential election. Thomas chided a distraught public in comments Friday at a judicial conference in Atlanta following the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would gut Roe v. Wade and a half-century of the right to an abortion. He complained that Americans are “addicted” to results they want — while “not living with” rulings they oppose. He warned that the court will not be “bullied” in the face of protest. Declining respect for the law and institutions, Thomas warned, “bodes ill for a free society.” Thomas detractors were agog. Not only has his wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, refused to “live with” the presidential election, he was the sole Supreme Court justice to vote that former President Donald Trump should not have to release his White House documents to the House committee investigating last year’s insurrection. Ginni Thomas, who had special access to the Trump administration because of her husband’s position, peppered then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with dozens of texts as she worked feverishly to upend the results of the election. That revelation in March triggered calls for Justice Thomas to recuse himself from all insurrection issues — or be impeached. Thomas has also repeatedly attempted to rip up legal precedence set by the court. “The irony is so thick you wonder if it’s maybe a Clarence Thomas impersonator,” former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman said on MSNBC Saturday. “Among other things, this is a guy who has spent a lifetime trying to take a battering ram to all the Supreme Court major precedents” of law, Litman added. “He’s now saying people don’t respect the law enough. That’s even leaving aside all the controversies he has engendered, as has his wife. It’s just ... remarkable.” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) wrote that it’s the Supreme Court aiming to “bully” women “into having government-mandated pregnancies.” Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) pointed out even before the speech that both Thomas and conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh were questioned about credible accusations of sexual misconduct in their confirmation hearings, yet are deciding reproductive rights for women. And that was just the beginning."

Wade Leak, LGBTQ+ People Are in Big Trouble","If we are to believe that the leaked U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is true and that the majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, makes the point that abortion isn't mentioned in the Constitution, then we are truly and frighteningly headed for the dark ages. The fact that women's rights will be almost negligible is only the beginning of what's to come. Brace yourselves for an onslaught of decisions that will also trample LGBTQ+ rights. The words gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer, to name a few, are not mentioned in the Constitution. Does that make our existence illegal? Think about what else isn't listed in the Constitution. Voting rights, civil rights, desegregation, trains, cars, planes, telephones, cell phones, computers, the abacus, toys, games, passports, bars, restaurants, watches, jewelry, donkeys, horses, and dogs. Are these all illegal? So what are these sanctimonious, narrow-minded, merciless firebrand, Bible-thumping, so-called justices preparing themselves to do next? They are gleefully ready to put Roe v. Wade in the trash bin of history. And because this decision is enormously consequential, my guess is that one of the justices (I guess Clarence Thomas) leaked the opinion in order to give states time to create their own anti-abortion laws before the SCOTUS decision is officially released, probably sometime late next month.Thomas is just that sadistic. He would do something like this because he and his wife have zero respect for the court and for the LGBTQ+ community. The leak was also a sign that if you are gay; if you are in a same-sex marriage; if you have sex; if you are transgender; if you're leaving an inheritance to your partner, husband, or wife; and on and on, you will be the next ""no mentions"" in the Constitution, and because of this, your rights will be stripped away. The overturning of Roe v. Wade should come as no surprise. Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch all gave various forms of vague responses to the case being precedent. The mealy-mouthed Sen. Susan Collins said that one of the reasons she was voting to confirm Kavanaugh to the court was that he told her he wouldn't overturn Roe v. Wade. How naive and utterly stupid was she to believe this liar. They all basically hem-hawed around discussion of Roe v. Wade but settled on all saying the same thing about precedent. That's exactly what they did when asked about same-sex marriage too. They danced around the issue, feigned ignorance, and ridiculously said they wouldn't comment on ""hypotheticals."" However, in their subversive minds, Roe and same-sex marriage were never hypotheticals. They were on their target lists. Religious zealots who were chosen for the court to do ""God's work.""Overturning Roe v. Wade is only a start. It lays down a marker for how far out these justices are willing to go. They are impervious to second-guessing, to appeals, to impeachment it seems. Six, and especially five, justices are out to demolish any rights that aren't ""listed in the Constitution"" but are listed in the Bible. They're using our precious document of freedom as a stabbing dagger and God's word as a sinister scalpel. We got cocky. We've had so many rulings in our favor over the last two decades. Obliviously, we celebrated Pride, toasted our nuptials, and enlisted in the military. We were on our way to one day passing an equality law, not only in Congress but in statehouses around the country. We were striving hard not to be a marginalized community. Alito, Kavanaugh, Coney Barrett, Gorsuch, and Thomas will do their utmost best to strip our marriage licenses, return us to dark alley bars, and make it a war crime for us to be in the military. These hideous and atrocious people sit in their high-backed chairs, with their highfalutin attitudes, and their subservient obedience to their higher power. Five cloistered individuals have the power to diminish, disparage, and deprecate our sexuality and identities and shred to pieces our carefully cultivated rainbow flag. Roe v. Wade is just a start, and if they have the insolence and impertinence -- the absolute gall -- to take away abortion rights, God help us for what comes next. I fear the worst. We can fight back at the ballot box. And while that is true, to so many it feels like it's not enough -- but the power of a vote is important here. If every single one of us went to the polls, we'd make a difference; however, until we have that opportunity to cast our vote, we are going to be ripped to shreds by the pious right The ultra-right-wingers have been calling us pedophiles and groomers and buttoning our mouths and taking away our books in libraries. Now that they have won the abortion battle, they are going to take all that they have done to us so far this year and use it as ammunition to call us out as immoral and call on the court to strike us down -- in every capacity. The disgusting moral uppishness of these so-called Christians is sin. Full stop. My grandmother always said that those who do you evil here on Earth will have a price to pay when they go to hell. I told them all that they will burn in hell a couple weeks ago. I still think that's true, and that my grandmother was right, but today after the alarm of Roe v. Wade, I don't think that living in hell is punishment enough. We thought our fight was finally coming to an end. The overturning of Roe v. Wade proves our fight is just beginning, and it's not going to be easy, pretty, or victimless."
